# MQ x TIE ONE DROP — ARTWORK STRATEGY (REVISED)
**Date**: 2026-02-13  
**Strategy**: Two-track approach (MQ Tie One tribute + MQ signature work)

---

## CRITICAL CLARIFICATION

**Track 1**: MQ's Tie One tribute artwork (hero pieces for drop)  
**Track 2**: MQ's signature work (parallel merchandise)  
**Track 3**: Rossi gallery analysis (separate, for future drops)

---

## PART 1: TIE ONE STYLE RESEARCH (For MQ to Emulate)

### Tie One's Signature Style
**Letterforms**:
- Wildstyle throw-ups with exaggerated, angular extensions
- Bold, straightforward letters optimized for speed
- "TIE" or "T1E" in 3D wildstyle with sharp outlines
- Jagged, extended letters with flares for motion

**Colors**:
- Primary bold hues: Reds, blacks, whites
- Fiery reds/oranges against gray backdrops
- High-contrast fills for quick readability

**Aesthetic**:
- Raw, prolific bombing approach
- Simple, quick throw-ups
- Volume through rapid layering
- Urban infrastructure (pipes, fire escapes, rooftops)

**Iconic Imagery**:
- Rooftop bombing scenes
- Fire escape silhouettes
- Rail car pieces
- Tenderloin SF backdrop

---

## PART 2: BEST TIE ONE IMAGE TO EMULATE

### Option A: Rooftop Bombing Scene (RECOMMENDED)
**Description**: Silhouette of Tie climbing fire escape with spray can, "TIE ONE" throw-up in red/black against SF skyline

**Why**: 
- Honors his final moments (shot on fire escape at 120 Taylor St)
- Captures his devotion to graffiti
- Visually powerful (silhouette + wildstyle)
- Works on clothing (dramatic, storytelling)

**Execution**:
- MQ creates original piece in Tie's style
- Black silhouette climber
- Red/black "TIE ONE" wildstyle
- SF skyline or Tenderloin building backdrop
- Buddhist-inspired halo (Tie was Buddhist)

---

### Option B: Rail Car Tribute
**Description**: "TIE ONE" wildstyle on rail car, with dates 1979-1998

**Why**:
- Tie was prolific on rail yards (Oakland/Emeryville)
- Classic graffiti imagery
- Works on clothing (horizontal format)

**Execution**:
- MQ recreates Tie's wildstyle on rail car
- Bold reds, blacks, whites
- "TIE ONE 1979-1998" with RIP or heart

---

### Option C: "TIE" Throw-Up (Simple)
**Description**: Clean "TIE" throw-up in Tie's style, no background

**Why**:
- Simplest to execute
- Most versatile for clothing
- Pure graffiti, no narrative

**Execution**:
- MQ writes "TIE" in Tie's wildstyle
- Red/black/white
- Clean, bold, scalable

## PART 8: ROSSI GALLERY ANALYSIS (TRACK 3 - FUTURE)

**Separate Strategy**: The Rossi gallery images (RSFM Monogram, Green Wildstyle, Pink Victorian, MAN Tag) are excellent for **future drops** or **Rossi-branded merchandise**.

**Recommendation**: 
- Use MQ artwork for **MQ x Tie One drop** (March 21)
- Use Rossi gallery artwork for **Rossi Mission branded drop** (April/May)
- Keep strategies separate to avoid confusion

**Rossi Gallery Drop** (Future):
- RSFM Monogram = Rossi Mission logo
- Green Wildstyle, Pink Victorian = SF-themed pieces
- Target: Rossi regulars, SF locals, tourists

---

## DECISION POINT

**Before proceeding**, we need:

1. ✅ MQ's agreement to participate
2. ✅ MQ's existing Tie One artwork OR commission new piece
3. ✅ MQ's signature pieces for parallel merchandise
4. ✅ Artwork licensing terms and pricing

**Timeline**: Need MQ response by Feb 20 (7 days) to hit March 21 drop date.

**Backup Plan**: If MQ unavailable or artwork not ready, delay to April 25.
