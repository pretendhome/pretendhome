**Agent**: Argentavis (Argy) | **Phase**: 1 — Research | **Date**: 2026-02-11

## Executive Summary

The MQ x Tie One drop serves four distinct audience segments: **Graffiti/Street Art Community**, **Art Collectors**, **Streetwear/Hypebeast Culture**, and **General Public/Media**. Each segment has different motivations, price sensitivities, channels, and conversion triggers. The total addressable market ranges from ~50,000 (core graffiti community) to 100M+ (streetwear-adjacent consumers), but Rossi's drop should target a **realistic conversion of 200-500 buyers** across all segments for a first drop. This document maps each segment with sizing, channels, and cross-audience bridge strategies.

---

## 1. Segment 1: Graffiti / Street Art Community

### Who They Are
Active and retired graffiti writers, sticker artists, mural painters, and their immediate circle. They know who MQ is. They know who Tie One was. They care about the culture, the crews, and the code.

### Estimated Size
| Metric | Estimate | Source |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Active US graffiti writers | 50,000-100,000 | Industry estimate based on crew documentation |
| 12ozProphet Instagram | 49,000 followers | Instagram |
| Bombing Science forum | Active community | bombingscience.com |
| Spraydaily followers | Significant archive | spraydaily.com |
| Sticker Museum community | Niche but dedicated | sticker.museum |

**Realistic addressable**: 10,000-25,000 (those who would be aware of MQ x Tie One through organic channels)

### Motivations
- **Respect**: Honoring a fallen writer is sacred in graffiti culture
- **Authenticity**: MQ is verified DMS crew, 25-year tribute history — this is real
- **Collectibility**: Original MQ sticker art already trades on eBay
- **Community solidarity**: Supporting the culture's own

### Price Sensitivity
- **High price sensitivity** for most. Writers are not typically affluent.
- Sweet spot: **$5-$50** (stickers, pins, zines, basic tees)
- Some will stretch to **$100-$200** for a signed print
- Very few will pay $500+ for originals (but those who do are serious)

### Top Channels
1. **Instagram** — Primary platform for graffiti culture. Tag @mqism, use graffiti-specific hashtags
2. **12ozProphet Forum** — Still active, deeply respected in the community
3. **Bombing Science** — Forums + shop, reaches active writers
4. **Word of mouth / crew networks** — DMS, BBB, NYHC connections
5. **Sticker swaps / mail art networks** — MQ's existing sticker distribution channels

### Conversion Trigger
"MQ is doing a definitive Tie One tribute collection. First time this work will be available through a gallery. Limited run."

## 2. Segment 2: Art Collectors (Urban/Contemporary)

### Who They Are
Collectors who buy street art, urban art, and contemporary art from galleries, auction houses, and online platforms. Range from entry-level collectors ($100-$1,000/year) to serious collectors ($10,000+/year).

### Estimated Size
| Metric | Estimate | Source |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Global art market | $57.5 billion (2024) | Multiple market reports |
| Online art market | $10.98 billion (2024) | Market research |
| Under-$5K art market | Growing significantly | Market trend data |
| Banksy auction sales (2024) | $20.1 million | Artnet |
| Artsy platform users | Millions of registered collectors | Artsy |
| 1stDibs urban art | Active category | 1stDibs |

**Realistic addressable**: 5,000-15,000 (collectors interested in NYC graffiti art at MQ's price point)

### Motivations
- **Investment potential**: Early acquisition of undervalued artist with verified 1980s NYC credentials
- **Cultural capital**: Owning a piece connected to the Keith Haring / Basquiat era
- **Narrative value**: The Tie One tribute story adds emotional weight that increases perceived value
- **Discovery**: Collectors love finding artists before the market catches up

### Price Sensitivity
- **Moderate to low price sensitivity** — they expect to pay fair market for art
- Entry: **$100-$300** (open edition prints, merch)
- Core: **$300-$1,500** (limited prints, signed works on paper)
- Premium: **$1,500-$5,000** (originals, unique works)

### Top Channels
1. **Artsy** — Primary discovery platform for contemporary art collectors
2. **Instagram** — Art world uses IG heavily for discovery and direct sales
3. **Gallery network** — Martinez Gallery (MQ's gallery) can introduce to their collector base
4. **Art fairs** — If timed with Art Market SF or similar
5. **Online art press** — Juxtapoz (1.3M IG followers), Hyperallergic, Arrested Motion, Brooklyn Street Art

### Conversion Trigger
"1980s NYC graffiti legend MQ — from the same Manhattan scene as Haring and Basquiat — releases a tribute collection for Tie One. Gallery-represented, documented career, priced under $5K for originals."

## 3. Segment 3: Streetwear / Hypebeast Culture

### Who They Are
Streetwear consumers, resellers, sneakerheads, and culture enthusiasts. They buy limited drops, follow StockX, and value scarcity + branding + cultural authenticity.

### Estimated Size
| Metric | Estimate | Source |
|--------|----------|--------|
| US streetwear market (2025) | $99.46 billion | Fortune Business Insights |

| Under-25 consumers | Majority of market | Mordor Intelligence |

**Realistic addressable**: 50,000-200,000 (those who follow graffiti-adjacent streetwear and would see the drop)

### Motivations
- **FOMO**: 60% buy limited editions specifically due to fear of missing out
- **Resale potential**: Will the drop appreciate? Limited + narrative = yes
- **Cultural credibility**: Wearing a real graffiti artist collab (not a corporate facsimile)
- **Social media flex**: Owning something exclusive and story-rich for content

### Price Sensitivity
- **Moderate** — willing to pay premium for perceived scarcity and cultural capital
- Entry: **$15-$40** (stickers, accessories)
- Core: **$50-$100** (graphic tees, hats)
- Premium: **$120-$250** (hoodies, limited accessories)
- They will NOT pay fine art prices unless they're also art collectors

### Top Channels
1. **Instagram** — Primary discovery + purchase platform
2. **TikTok** — Short-form content about the story behind the drop
3. **Hypebeast / Highsnobiety** — Press coverage drives streetwear awareness
4. **StockX / Grailed** — Secondary market validates primary market
5. **Reddit** (r/streetwear, r/supremeclothing) — Community discussion

### Conversion Trigger
"Limited drop. NYC graffiti legend. Tribute to a slain artist. Only available at one gallery in SF. When it's gone, it's gone."

## 4. Segment 4: General Public / Media / Social Justice

### Who They Are
People drawn to the **story**, not necessarily the art or the streetwear. Includes journalists, social justice advocates, Asian-American community, true crime enthusiasts, and general culture consumers.

### Why This Segment Matters
Tie One's death — an unarmed 18-year-old Filipino immigrant shot for graffiti, shooter exonerated, "Jackie Chan" racial quote — is a story that transcends the graffiti world. It connects to:
- **Asian-American violence** — documented in Hidden History of Asian-American Graf Writers
- **Criminal justice reform** — unarmed teen, grand jury exoneration
- **Immigrant stories** — Filipino immigrant, raised Buddhist, sent to live with sister
- **Arts and free expression** — killed for painting

### Estimated Size
| Metric | Estimate | Source |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Asian-American population (US) | 24+ million | Census |
| Asian-American media outlets | Dozens (NextShark, Angry Asian Man, etc.) | Media landscape |
| True crime podcast listeners | 100M+ (US) | Edison Research |
| Social justice-oriented art buyers | Growing segment | Market trend |

**Realistic addressable**: 10,000-50,000 (those who encounter the story through media/social channels)

### Motivations
- **Social justice**: Supporting art that addresses racial violence and injustice
- **Cultural preservation**: Helping preserve the legacy of a marginalized artist
- **Emotional connection**: The story is deeply affecting even without graffiti knowledge
- **Gift-giving**: Meaningful purchase for someone who cares about these issues

### Price Sensitivity
- **High price sensitivity** — story-driven buyers, not art market buyers
- Entry: **$5-$25** (stickers, zines, pins)
- Core: **$30-$60** (tees, posters)
- Rarely above $100 unless deeply moved

### Top Channels
1. **Media coverage** — SF Chronicle, SFGate (they covered Tie One's death), Mission Local
2. **Asian-American media** — NextShark, Angry Asian Man, Hidden Research
3. **Podcasts** — True crime, social justice, art & culture
4. **Local SF press** — Mission District community, 791 Valencia Street neighborhood
5. **Social media amplification** — Viral potential of the "Jackie Chan" quote and injustice narrative

### Conversion Trigger
"In 1998, an 18-year-old Filipino artist was shot and killed for painting. The shooter called him 'Jackie Chan' and walked free. Now, 28 years later, the artist who's been keeping his memory alive is creating the definitive tribute."

## 5. Cross-Audience Bridge Analysis

### How KAWS Did It
KAWS is the definitive case study for cross-audience success:
- **Started**: Tagging billboards and bus stops in 1990s NYC (Segment 1)
- **Crossed to collectors**: $14.8M Sotheby's sale, gallery representation (Segment 2)
- **Crossed to streetwear**: Uniqlo collabs, Supreme connections (Segment 3)
- **Crossed to mainstream**: MoMA drops, Nike collabs, global recognition (Segment 4)

**Key insight**: KAWS didn't abandon his graffiti roots to cross over. He **expanded the story** while keeping the core authentic.

### How Virgil Abloh Did It
- **Started**: DJ, architecture student, Kanye West's creative director
- **Crossed**: Founded Off-White (streetwear → luxury). Appointed Louis Vuitton menswear artistic director.
- **Key quote**: "Streetwear is the new high fashion"
- **Bridge mechanism**: Collaborations that connect worlds (Nike x Off-White serves sneakerheads AND fashion)

### Cross-Audience Strategy for MQ x Tie One

| Bridge | From → To | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Stickers → Prints | Graffiti → Collectors | MQ's sticker art is already collected; gallery-framed versions elevate |
| Story → Product | General Public → Buyers | Media coverage creates awareness; merch makes it tangible |
| Scarcity → Demand | Streetwear → All | Limited edition drives FOMO across all segments |
| Gallery show → Press | Collectors → Media | Opening event creates media moment |
| Instagram → Community | All segments | Visual platform serves every audience |

| Graffiti community | 10,000-25,000 | 30% | 5% | 150-375 | $35 |

*Note: These are conservative first-drop estimates. The Rossi business plan targets $500K retail Year 1 across ALL artists and events. The MQ x Tie One drop is one event in that larger strategy.*
