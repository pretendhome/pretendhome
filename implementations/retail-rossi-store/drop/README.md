# MQ x Tie One — Artist Drop Package

**Project**: Rossi Mission
**Drop**: MQ x Tie One Tribute Collection
**Created**: 2026-02-11
**Status**: Complete — Awaiting ONE-WAY DOOR Confirmation

---

## What This Is

Rossi Mission's first major artist drop. MQ (MKUE/MQUE) — a documented NYC graffiti writer who emerged from the early 1980s Manhattan scene — creates a tribute collection honoring Tie One (Jonathan See Lim, 1979-1998), a Bay Area graffiti writer shot and killed at age 18. MQ has been creating Tie One tribute art for over 25 years.

**Note**: MQ started in the early 1980s (not 1970s). The claim that MQ "painted alongside Keith Haring" is unverified — the recommended framing is "came up in the same early 1980s Manhattan graffiti scene." See `phase-1-research/argy-mq-credibility.md`.

The goal: make this resonate far beyond the tagger community into art collectors, streetwear culture, media, and the general public.
