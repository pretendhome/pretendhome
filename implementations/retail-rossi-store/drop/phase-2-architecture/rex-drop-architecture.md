# Rex Architecture: Drop Structure
**Agent**: Rex (Revenue Architect) | **Phase**: 2 — Architecture | **Date**: 2026-02-11

---

## 3-Stage Reasoning

### Stage 1: Gradient Descent (Optimize for Revenue)
Pure revenue optimization says: maximize scarcity, price aggressively, target the highest-value segment (collectors), minimize SKUs to reduce COGS. This approach yields $40K-$70K from ~50 transactions at high ASP.

### Stage 2: Game Theory (Multi-Agent Dynamics)
But this isn't a single-player game. Four audiences have competing needs:
- **Graffiti community** expects accessibility and respect — pricing too high alienates the core
- **Collectors** want scarcity and investment potential — too much product dilutes value
- **Streetwear** wants FOMO and social currency — too few items means no engagement
- **Media** wants a story — no story, no coverage, no awareness for any segment

Optimizing for one segment sub-optimizes others. The **Nash equilibrium** is a price-laddered, narrative-driven, time-limited drop that gives every segment a reason to buy.

### Stage 3: Integration
The optimal architecture balances: narrative buildup (media + general) → scarcity signals (streetwear + collectors) → community inclusion (graffiti) → time-limited access (all segments). Format: **Exhibition Hybrid** — gallery opening + online drop + sustained availability window.

## 1. Drop Format Analysis

### Option A: Flash Drop
- **Mechanic**: Everything goes live at once. Sells out in minutes/hours.
- **Pros**: Maximum FOMO, press-worthy sellout, clean execution
- **Cons**: Excludes people who aren't online at the right moment, alienates graffiti community (many don't do e-commerce), no in-store experience
- **Best for**: Established brands with massive followings (Supreme, Nike SNKRS)
- **Verdict**: ❌ Wrong for a first drop. Rossi doesn't have the audience to generate a flash sellout.

### Option B: Narrative Buildup → Timed Release
- **Mechanic**: 4-8 weeks of story-driven content, building to a single release date
- **Pros**: Story reaches all 4 segments, builds anticipation, allows email list building
- **Cons**: Long timeline, requires sustained content production, risk of fatigue
- **Best for**: Story-driven drops with emotional weight
- **Verdict**: ✅ Strong — but needs modification. Pure online misses the gallery experience.

### Option C: Exhibition Hybrid (RECOMMENDED)
- **Mechanic**: Gallery exhibition opening (physical) + online drop (digital) within 24-48 hours
- **Pros**: Gallery event creates media moment + social content + collector access. Online drop extends reach nationally/globally. Exhibition runs 2-4 weeks for walk-in traffic.
- **Cons**: Requires coordinating physical and digital simultaneously. Inventory management across channels.
- **Best for**: Gallery-based drops with strong narrative. This IS Rossi's model.
- **Verdict**: ✅✅ Best fit. Leverages Rossi's physical space (791 Valencia) + Shopify for reach.

### Option D: Tiered Access
- **Mechanic**: Early access for VIPs/email list → General access → Remainder online
- **Pros**: Rewards loyal customers, creates status hierarchy
- **Cons**: Over-engineered for a first drop. Rossi doesn't have a VIP tier yet.
- **Verdict**: ❌ Save for Drop 2. Build the VIP list WITH this drop.

## 2. Recommended Architecture: Exhibition Hybrid

### Structure

```
T-8 weeks    NARRATIVE BUILDUP (content, press, email capture)
T-4 weeks    PRODUCT TEASE (reveal products, not prices)
T-2 weeks    PRICING REVEAL + PRE-REGISTRATION (email signup for early access)
T-1 week     FINAL PUSH (countdown, last-chance email capture)
T-0 (Fri)    GALLERY OPENING (in-store event, 6pm-10pm)
T+1 (Sat)    ONLINE DROP (10am PT, all products live on Shopify)
T+1 to T+14  EXHIBITION WINDOW (gallery open, remaining inventory)
T+14         EXHIBITION CLOSES (remaining inventory moves to online-only)
T+21         DROP OFFICIALLY ENDS (anything unsold becomes "sold out" forever)
```

### Why This Works

1. **Gallery opening (Friday night)**: Creates the media moment. Photography, social content, MQ present, story told in person. Collectors and graffiti community attend. Some hero pieces sell in-person.
2. **Online drop (Saturday morning)**: Catches streetwear buyers, national/global audience, people who couldn't attend. FOMO from sold-out gallery items drives online urgency.
3. **Exhibition window (2 weeks)**: Walk-in traffic at 791 Valencia. Mission District foot traffic. Tourists. People who heard about it through media coverage.
4. **Hard close**: Nothing restocked. "When it's gone, it's gone" must be real.

## 3. Channel Architecture

### Primary Channels

| Channel | Purpose | Phase |
|---------|---------|-------|
| **Rossi website (Shopify)** | E-commerce, product pages, email capture | T-8 through T+21 |
| **Instagram (@rossimission)** | Primary content channel, story, reels, drops | T-8 through T+21 |
| **Email list** | Direct communication, early access, post-drop | T-8 through T+21 |
| **Physical gallery** | Exhibition, opening event, walk-in sales | T-0 through T+14 |

### Secondary Channels

| Channel | Purpose | Phase |
|---------|---------|-------|
| **MQ's Instagram (@mqism)** | Authenticity signal, artist perspective | T-6 through T+7 |
| **Graffiti forums (12ozProphet)** | Community seeding | T-4 through T-1 |
| **Art press (Juxtapoz, Hyperallergic)** | Collector awareness | T-3 through T+1 |
| **Local press (SFGate, Mission Local)** | General public, Tie One story | T-2 through T+1 |
| **Streetwear press (Hypebeast)** | Streetwear audience | T-1 through T+1 |
| **Asian-American media** | Social justice angle | T-1 through T+7 |

### Channel Sequencing Logic
- **Graffiti community first** (T-4): They must hear about it from within the culture, not from mainstream press. If they hear about it from Hypebeast before 12ozProphet, it feels corporate.
- **Art press second** (T-3): Collectors need time to evaluate. Give them weeks, not days.
- **Local press third** (T-2): The Tie One / SF story is local. SF media amplifies.
- **Streetwear press last** (T-1): FOMO works on short timelines. Hit streetwear 1 week before drop.

## 5. Event Format: Gallery Opening

### Structure (T-0, Friday 6pm-10pm)

| Time | Element |
|------|---------|
| 6-7pm | Doors open, DJ, drinks. Art on walls. Products displayed (not yet for sale). |
| 7-7:30pm | MQ speaks: Tie One story, 25-year tribute, what the art means. 5-10 min. |
| 7:30-10pm | Art and products for sale. MQ present for signing. Photos. Community. |
| 10pm | Doors close. Post-event content push. |

### Logistics
- **Capacity**: 791 Valencia — estimate 80-120 people over 4 hours
- **Drinks**: Simple (beer, wine, water). No liquor license complications.
- **Music**: DJ or playlist aligned with NYHC / graffiti culture
- **Photography**: Professional photographer for press + social content
- **Sales**: Square/POS for in-store purchases. Cash option for graffiti community.

## 6. ONE-WAY DOOR: Drop Format

**Decision**: Exhibition Hybrid (gallery opening + online drop + 2-week exhibition window)

**Why this is irreversible**: Once announced, the format sets expectations for attendees, online buyers, and press. Changing mid-execution creates confusion and undermines trust.

**Confirmation required before Phase 3.**

---

## 7. ONE-WAY DOOR: Drop Date

### Considerations
- MQ must travel from NYC to SF — needs 2+ weeks notice
- Avoid major competing events (Art Market SF, Outside Lands, etc.)
- Friday opening is standard for gallery events
- Allow 8 weeks for narrative buildup
- Consider Tie One's death anniversary: **March 18** — could be powerful or could feel exploitative

### Options

| Option | Date | Rationale | Risk |
|--------|------|-----------|------|
| **A: Anniversary drop** | March 14 (Fri) or March 21 (Fri) | Near March 18 anniversary. Emotional resonance. Press hook. | Could feel exploitative if not handled carefully |
| **B: Spring drop** | Late April / Early May | Neutral timing. Weather good for gallery event. Distance from anniversary avoids sensitivity. | Less natural press hook |
| **C: Summer drop** | June-July | Maximum foot traffic in Mission. Summer energy. | Far from plan creation. Momentum may slow. |

**Recommendation**: Option A (near anniversary) — the March 18 date is a natural press hook and aligns with the tribute narrative. Frame as "honoring the 28th anniversary" rather than "capitalizing on death date." Tie One's community has been marking this date for decades.

**Confirmation required before Phase 3.**
