# Rex Architecture: ONE-WAY DOOR Decisions
**Agent**: Rex (Revenue Architect) | **Phase**: 2 — Architecture | **Date**: 2026-02-11

## What This Document Is

ONE-WAY DOORS are irreversible decisions. Once made, they cannot be undone without significant cost, reputation damage, or lost momentum. Each decision below requires human confirmation before Phase 3 (build specs) can proceed.

**Two-way doors** (reversible decisions like social media captions, email subject lines, product descriptions) are NOT included here — those can be adjusted on the fly.

## Decision 1: Drop Date

### Why This Is Irreversible
Once a date is announced, press outreach begins, MQ books travel, venues are confirmed, and community expectations are set. Moving the date signals disorganization and undermines trust.

### Options

| Option | Date | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|------|
| **A: Near Anniversary** | Friday, March 14 or March 21 | Natural press hook (March 18 = Tie One's death anniversary). Emotional resonance. Community already marks this date. | Could feel exploitative if not handled carefully. Tight timeline from now (~5-6 weeks). |
| **B: Spring** | Friday, April 25 or May 2 | More prep time (10-12 weeks). Neutral timing avoids sensitivity. Better weather. | No natural press hook. Loses momentum from current planning energy. |
| **C: Summer** | Friday, June 13 or June 20 | Maximum prep time. Peak foot traffic in Mission. | Very far out. Planning momentum may stall. MQ may lose availability window. |

### Recommendation
**Option A (March 21)** — One week after the March 18 anniversary. Allows press to reference the anniversary without dropping ON the date itself. 6-week timeline is tight but feasible with the Exhibition Hybrid format.

If timeline is too tight: **Option B (April 25)** as fallback.

## Decision 2: Drop Format

### Why This Is Irreversible
Format determines venue setup, online infrastructure, staffing, production quantities, and how every piece of marketing is framed. Changing format mid-execution cascades across all workstreams.

### Options

| Option | Format | Pros | Cons |
|--------|--------|------|------|
| **A: Exhibition Hybrid** | Gallery opening (Fri) + online drop (Sat) + 2-week exhibition | Best of both worlds. Creates media moment AND digital reach. Leverages Rossi's physical space. | Requires coordinating physical + digital. Higher event costs (~$3K). |
| **B: Online-Only Drop** | Timed release on Shopify, no physical event | Simpler execution. Lower cost. National reach from day 1. | No media moment. No gallery experience. Doesn't leverage 791 Valencia. Feels like e-commerce, not art. |
| **C: Gallery-Only** | Exhibition at 791 Valencia, no online | Maximum in-person experience. Art world credibility. | Limits audience to SF locals. Excludes graffiti community nationally. Lower revenue ceiling. |

### Recommendation
**Option A: Exhibition Hybrid** — This is Rossi's natural model. The gallery space IS the differentiator. The online component extends reach.

## Decision 3: Edition Sizes

### Why This Is Irreversible
Production must be ordered 4-6 weeks before the drop. Once ordered, you own the inventory. Over-production = dead stock. Under-production = missed revenue and no way to restock without undermining "limited" credibility.

### Options

| Option | Approach | Total Units | Total COGS | Risk |
|--------|----------|-------------|------------|------|
| **A: Conservative** | 30% fewer units than moderate | ~900 | ~$8,000 | Lower revenue ceiling. May sell out too fast (good problem). |
| **B: Moderate** | Calibrated for 80% sellthrough | ~1,264 | ~$11,500 | Balanced. ~250 unsold units in conservative scenario. |
| **C: Aggressive** | 50% more than moderate | ~1,900 | ~$17,000 | Higher revenue if demand materializes. Risk of sitting on $6K+ of unsold inventory. |

### Recommendation
**Option B: Moderate** — First drop should prioritize learning over maximizing. Better to sell out and prove demand than to sit on inventory. The ~$11.5K COGS is recoverable at just 32% sellthrough.

## Decision 4: Pricing

### Why This Is Irreversible
Prices are published on the website, in press coverage, and in customer communications. Raising prices post-announcement looks like a cash grab. Lowering prices devalues the work and signals the drop didn't sell. Neither is acceptable.

### Options

| Option | Entry | Tees | Prints (Ltd) | Originals | Hero | Positioning |
|--------|-------|------|-------------|-----------|------|-------------|
| **A: Accessible** | $5 | $35 | $150 | $500 | $1,500 | Below current MQ market. Community-first. |
| **B: Market-rate** | $10 | $48 | $250 | $800-$1,500 | $2,500 | At/slightly above MQ market with tribute premium. |
| **C: Premium** | $15 | $65 | $400 | $1,500-$3,000 | $5,000 | Positions MQ at lower Tier 2. Aspirational. |

### Revenue Impact by Pricing Option
| Option | Moderate Sellthrough Revenue | Rossi Take |
|--------|----------------------------|------------|
| A: Accessible | ~$35,000 | ~$12,000 |
| B: Market-rate | ~$51,500 | ~$18,500 |
| C: Premium | ~$75,000 | ~$27,000 |

### Recommendation
**Option B: Market-rate** — Consistent with MQ's current market ($100-$500 at Village Works) plus a justified tribute premium. Premium enough to signal value, accessible enough to include the graffiti community. Option C is achievable in a second drop once the market has been proven.

## Decision 5: Narrative Framing

### Why This Is Irreversible
The story, once told publicly, becomes the permanent frame. Press coverage, social media posts, and community perception cannot be un-done. Getting the narrative wrong on day one poisons everything.

### Options

| Option | Framing | Pros | Cons |
|--------|---------|------|------|
| **A: Brotherhood-led** | "25 years of tribute. MQ honoring his friend." | Authentic. Positive. Centers the art. | May not generate enough attention from general press. |
| **B: Justice-led** | "Unarmed teen killed. Shooter walked. Art fights back." | Emotionally powerful. Press-worthy. Viral potential. | Risks exploitation. Sensationalizes death. May alienate graffiti community who see it as culture tourism. |
| **C: Hybrid (RECOMMENDED)** | Brotherhood-led with justice context. "25 years of tribute" is the headline. The injustice is context for those who dig deeper. | Authentic AND newsworthy. Respects all stakeholders. Lets each audience find their own entry point. | Requires careful copywriting to maintain balance. |

### Specific Commitments (if Option C)
1. Use "came up in the same early 1980s Manhattan scene" — NOT "painted alongside Keith Haring"
2. Lead with the art and the 25-year tribute — NOT with the shooting
3. Include Tie One's full humanity — NOT just his death
4. Treat "Jackie Chan" quote as editorial context — NOT marketing copy
5. Frame Rossi as host/platform — NOT as the protagonist

### Recommendation
**Option C: Hybrid** — Leads with brotherhood, provides justice context for those who seek it.

## Decision 6: Revenue Allocation (Tie One Tribute)

### Why This Is Irreversible
Once announced publicly, a commitment to allocate proceeds is a binding promise. Failing to follow through would be catastrophic. But NOT allocating anything also sets a tone — "we profited from a dead artist's story without giving back."

### Options

| Option | Allocation | Pros | Cons |
|--------|-----------|------|------|
| **A: No allocation** | 100% standard split (50/50 MQ/Rossi after COGS) | Simplest. MQ has been honoring Tie One for free for 25 years — nobody can accuse him of profiteering. | Misses opportunity to strengthen narrative. Press may ask "where does the money go?" |
| **B: Family allocation** | 10-15% of net to Tie One's family (if contactable and willing) | Ethically strongest. Powerful narrative: "MQ is sharing the tribute with Tie One's family." | Requires finding and contacting family. Legal/tax complexity. Family may not want involvement. |
| **C: Community cause** | 10-15% of net to graffiti arts education or Asian-American arts fund | Honors Tie One's legacy through community impact. No family contact required. Press-friendly. | Less personal than family allocation. |
| **D: Hybrid** | 10% to cause + offer to family if contactable | Covers both bases. Acts immediately (cause) while leaving door open (family). | More complex to administer. |

### Recommendation
**Option D: Hybrid** — Commit 10% of net proceeds to a graffiti arts education fund or Asian-American arts organization. Simultaneously attempt to contact Tie One's family through community connections (Low Key Skate Shop, SF graffiti community). If family wants involvement, adjust allocation with their input.

At moderate scenario: 10% of $37,030 net = **$3,703** to cause.

## Next Steps After Confirmation

Once all 6 ONE-WAY DOORS are confirmed (or modified):
1. Phase 3 (Theri) builds exact specs for landing page, email sequences, social calendar, Shopify flows, and automation opportunities
2. Phase 4 (Yuty) assembles everything into the master playbook
3. Phase 4 (Anky) validates against 10 quality dimensions
