Hey MQ,

Rossi Mission here (791 Valencia St, SF). We want to honor Tie One (Jonathan See Lim, 1979-1998) with a tribute exhibition featuring your artwork.

We saw your 2022 Tie One sticker pack with Low Key Skate Shop — powerful work. We want to bring that tribute into a gallery setting for the first time, in SF, Tie's city.

**The Vision**:
- Gallery opening: March 21 (near the March 18 anniversary)
- Exhibition + online drop with merchandise (tees, hoodies, prints)
- You present, we cover travel + accommodation
- 50/50 revenue split on all merchandise

**What We Need**:
- Your existing Tie One tribute artwork (high-res files)
- OR commission a new piece (we're thinking rooftop bombing scene honoring his legacy)
- 3-5 of your signature pieces for MQ-branded merchandise

Can we talk this week? Call or video chat?

Best,
J from Rossi Mission

## TALKING POINTS (FOR PHONE/VIDEO CALL)

### Opening (1 minute):
"Thanks for taking the time. Rossi Mission is a graffiti art gallery in SF's Mission District. We want to honor Tie One with a tribute exhibition featuring your work. We saw your 2022 sticker pack with Low Key — that's the kind of tribute we want to bring into a gallery for the first time."

### The Ask (2 minutes):
"We need artwork for merchandise — tees, hoodies, hats, prints. Ideally:
1. Your existing Tie One tribute pieces (high-res files)
2. OR we commission a new piece — maybe a rooftop bombing scene honoring his legacy
3. Plus 3-5 of your signature MQ pieces for parallel merchandise

Timeline is tight — March 21 opening, so we need artwork by March 1."

### The Deal (2 minutes):
"Two options:
1. **Revenue split**: 50/50 on all merchandise sales. We handle production, marketing, event. You provide artwork and show up for opening.
2. **Commission**: We pay you upfront per piece ($500-$2,000 depending on complexity), we own merchandise rights for this drop only.

Either way, you retain artwork ownership, we credit you on everything, and we cover your travel + accommodation for the opening."

### The Why (1 minute):
"This is the first gallery exhibition of Tie One tribute art. It's happening in SF, his city, near the anniversary. Your tribute work deserves to be seen beyond stickers — in a gallery, on walls, worn by people who remember him."

### Close (1 minute):
"What do you think? Does this interest you? What questions do you have?"

### Option B: Commission Different Artist
- Find Bay Area graffiti artist who knew Tie One
