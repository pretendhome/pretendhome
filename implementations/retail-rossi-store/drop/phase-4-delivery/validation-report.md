## Dimension Scores

### 1. Completeness (9/10)
All planned deliverables produced:
- ✅ 6 Argy research documents with real market data
- ✅ 4 Rex architecture documents with 3-stage reasoning
- ✅ 5 Theri build specs with acceptance criteria
- ✅ Master playbook assembled
- ✅ Asset files (personas, pricing matrix)
- ✅ Checklists (pre-launch, launch day, post-launch)
- ✅ Risk register

**Deduction (-1)**: No MQ interview data (recommended in research but not yet conducted). This is expected — interviews happen during execution, not planning.

### 2. Evidence Quality (8/10)
Research grounded in verifiable sources:
- ✅ Supreme revenue: $523M (BoF, Modern Retail)
- ✅ KAWS auction: $14.8M Sotheby's (Artsy)
- ✅ Yeezy revenue: $819M 2023 (Hypebeast, Sportico)
- ✅ Tie One death: Multiple SFGate articles, court records
- ✅ MQ credentials: Living Proof NY, Martinez Gallery, i-D Magazine, Dr. Martens
- ✅ Nipsey Hussle merch: $10M+ (Billboard)
- ✅ Basquiat King Pleasure: 300K visitors (GothamToGo)

**Deduction (-2)**: Some pricing data points are estimated rather than directly sourced (e.g., Cope2 canvas pricing ranges from Rossi's existing research rather than verified auction records). MQ's current market pricing has limited data points (Village Works NYC listing).

### 3. Narrative Clarity (10/10)
- ✅ Core story is clear and compelling in 1 sentence and 5 minutes
- ✅ Four audience-specific narrative versions provided
- ✅ Press pitch templates for 3 outlet types
- ✅ Cultural sensitivity framework with red/yellow/green lines
- ✅ Keith Haring claim correctly flagged and reframed
- ✅ Emotional arc mapped: Curiosity → Recognition → Empathy → Connection → Anticipation → Catharsis → Urgency → Resolution

No deductions. The narrative work is the strongest element of this package.

### 4. Financial Rigor (8/10)
- ✅ Three scenarios with unit-level economics
- ✅ COGS calculated per product
- ✅ Break-even analysis (32% sellthrough)
- ✅ Event cost budget ($2,300-$3,700)
- ✅ Integration with Rossi $500K retail Year 1 target
- ✅ ROI calculated per scenario (105%-274%)

**Deduction (-2)**: COGS estimates are approximations based on typical production costs, not actual vendor quotes. Shipping costs not modeled in detail (flat rates assumed). No cash flow timing analysis (when does COGS cash outflow vs. revenue inflow?).

### 5. Actionability (9/10)
- ✅ Every spec has acceptance criteria
- ✅ Checklists are standalone and printable
- ✅ Timeline has specific actions per week
- ✅ Product table has exact quantities, prices, SKU naming
- ✅ Email sequences have subject lines, body structure, segmentation
- ✅ Social calendar has 40 posts with captions, formats, image requirements
- ✅ Shopify setup is step-by-step

**Deduction (-1)**: Some specs assume Rossi already has certain tools (Klaviyo, Back in Stock app) — should note these as setup prerequisites.

### 6. ONE-WAY DOORS (10/10)
- ✅ All 6 irreversible decisions identified
- ✅ Each has 3 options with pros/cons
- ✅ Each has a clear recommendation with rationale
- ✅ Each has explicit "HUMAN CONFIRMATION REQUIRED" gate
- ✅ Consolidated in one document AND referenced in playbook
- ✅ Revenue impact calculated per pricing option

No deductions. The decision framework is rigorous and clear.

### 7. Risk Identification (8/10)
- ✅ 9 risks in register with probability, impact, mitigation
- ✅ "Tie One's family objects" correctly flagged as CRITICAL
- ✅ Exploitation backlash addressed with specific mitigation (narrative framework)
- ✅ Over-production risk mitigated by break-even analysis
- ✅ XXXTentacion cautionary tale provides anti-pattern

**Deduction (-2)**: Missing risks: (1) MQ's art quality — what if the tribute pieces don't meet gallery standard? (2) Legal risk — any IP concerns with Tie One's name/likeness? (3) Competitor timing — what if another tribute event coincides?

### 8. Cultural Sensitivity (9/10)
- ✅ Red/yellow/green line framework in narrative arc
- ✅ "Never sensationalize shooting details for marketing"
- ✅ "Never use death photo or crime scene imagery"
- ✅ "Never claim Tie One would have wanted this"
- ✅ Revenue allocation to community cause recommended
- ✅ Tie One's full humanity emphasized throughout
- ✅ Keith Haring claim reframed to verifiable statement

**Deduction (-1)**: Family outreach is recommended but no specific plan for HOW to contact them. Should specify: who reaches out (MQ? Rossi?), what's the script, what if they say no?

### 9. Operational Readiness (8/10)
- ✅ Shopify setup is fully specced
- ✅ POS workflow defined
- ✅ Email automation configured
- ✅ Social calendar with 40 posts planned
- ✅ Event logistics costed and detailed
- ✅ Production lead times identified (enamel pins = critical path)

**Deduction (-2)**: Missing: (1) Specific vendor recommendations for production (print shop, tee printer, pin manufacturer). (2) Staffing plan for opening night beyond security. (3) Day-of run-of-show with named owners for each task.

### 10. Integration with Rossi Business Plan (8/10)
- ✅ Revenue contribution mapped to $500K Year 1 retail target (7-12%)
- ✅ 50/50 split model applied correctly
- ✅ Revenue per square foot calculated and compared to industry
- ✅ Strategic value beyond revenue documented (proof of concept, email list, press, pipeline signal)
- ✅ Drop model positioned as repeatable template

**Deduction (-2)**: Missing explicit connection to other business plan streams (could the opening event count toward the $60K events target? Could an MQ workshop count toward $80K workshops?). No explicit link to the funding gap ($185-200K needed) — could this drop attract investor confidence?

## Top Strengths

1. **Narrative framework** is exceptional — the brotherhood-led story with justice context, cultural sensitivity red/yellow/green lines, and per-segment messaging gives Rossi a sophisticated communication strategy
2. **ONE-WAY DOOR decision framework** is thorough — 6 decisions, each with 3 options, clear recommendations, and human confirmation gates
3. **Price ladder design** follows proven models (Basquiat/Keith Haring) — $10 entry to $2,500 hero ensures every audience segment can participate
4. **Break-even at 32%** means very favorable risk/reward for a first drop

## Top Gaps to Address

1. **Get actual vendor quotes** for COGS before confirming pricing (estimates are reasonable but should be verified)
2. **Create family outreach plan** — who, when, how, what if they decline
3. **Add missing risks**: art quality, legal/IP, competitor timing
4. **Get MQ interview** to verify personal connection details and unlock stronger narrative content
5. **Specify tool prerequisites** — list exactly which Shopify apps and email platform need to be set up

## Recommendation

This package is ready for ONE-WAY DOOR review. The human should:
1. Review the 6 pending decisions in `rex-one-way-doors.md`
2. Confirm or modify each decision
3. Address the top 5 gaps above during execution
4. Proceed to production and narrative buildup
