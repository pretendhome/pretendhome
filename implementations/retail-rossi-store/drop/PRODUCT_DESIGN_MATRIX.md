# MQ x TIE ONE DROP — PRODUCT DESIGN MATRIX
**Date**: 2026-02-13  
**Status**: PRE-ARTWORK PLANNING  
**Method**: Design products first, then source artwork to fit

---

## CRITICAL CONSTRAINT

**We don't have MQ or Tie One artwork yet.**

**Solution**: Design the product line based on:
1. **Tie One's documented style** (wildstyle, reds/blacks, rooftop imagery)
2. **MQ's documented style** (NYC graffiti, DMS crew, bold throw-ups)
3. **Streetwear market fit probability** (what sells in graffiti/streetwear drops)

## PART 5: DECISION MATRIX

### Question 1: Focused (7 SKUs) or Expanded (10 SKUs)?

**Focused Pros**:
- Lower investment ($16K vs $22K)
- Lower risk (fewer SKUs to sell through)
- Easier to manage production
- Faster sellthrough

**Expanded Pros**:
- Higher revenue potential ($47K vs $31K)
- More options for customers
- Better ROI (117% vs 92%)
- Captures more market segments

**Recommendation**: **FOCUSED** for first drop (lower risk, prove concept)

---

### Question 2: Include Crewneck and Tote?

**Crewneck**: ⚠️ MAYBE
- Adds $6,150 revenue potential
- But cannibalizes hoodie sales
- Skip unless we have strong Tie One artwork

**Tote**: ✅ YES
- Low COGS ($8), good margin
- SF culture fit (no plastic bags)
- Functional (people use it)
- Add to Focused option

---

### Question 3: Pants or Jacket?

**Answer**: ❌ NO
- Too high risk for first drop
- Wrong season (spring)
- High COGS, complex sizing
- Graffiti drops rarely include these
- Save for future drops if this one succeeds
