## RECOMMENDED ACTION PLAN

### Immediate (Next 2 Weeks)
1. **Apply to Svane Family Foundation Culture Forward** (Deadline: March 1, 2026)
   - Frame MQ x Tie One drop as bringing Mission District graffiti culture to Downtown SF
   - Propose pop-up exhibition or collaboration with Downtown venue
   - Emphasize attracting young professionals/students

### Short-Term (Next 1-2 Months)
2. **Contact SF Arts Commission** about 2026-2027 grant cycle
   - Email: sfac.grants@sfgov.org
   - Ask: When does 2026-2027 cycle open?
   - Ask: Can Rossi Mission apply as a for-profit arts business, or do we need fiscal sponsorship?

3. **Apply to California Employment Training Panel (ETP) Grant**
   - Ongoing program, no deadline pressure
   - Use for employee training (graffiti art curation, gallery operations, retail management)

### Medium-Term (Next 3-6 Months)
4. **Prepare for SF Arts Commission 2026-2027 cycle** (likely opens Spring 2026)
   - Decide which grant to apply for:
     - **Special Project Grant** ($50K) — Best for MQ x Tie One drop or similar one-time projects
     - **Artistic Legacy Grant** ($100K) — Best for ongoing gallery operations
     - **Arts Impact Endowment** ($50K-$100K) — Best for gallery growth/expansion
   - Gather required materials:
     - Project budget
     - Timeline
     - Community impact statement
     - Artist bios
     - Letters of support

5. **Consider fiscal sponsorship** (if needed for SFAC grants)
   - Some SFAC grants require 501(c)(3) status
   - Rossi Mission is for-profit, so may need fiscal sponsor
   - Options: Intersection for the Arts, Fractured Atlas, SF Arts Commission fiscal sponsorship program

---

## FISCAL SPONSORSHIP RESEARCH (IF NEEDED)

If SF Arts Commission grants require 501(c)(3) status, Rossi Mission can apply through a fiscal sponsor:

### What is fiscal sponsorship?
- A 501(c)(3) nonprofit "sponsors" your project
- You apply for grants under their tax-exempt status
- They take 5-15% administrative fee
- You maintain creative control

### SF-based fiscal sponsors for arts projects:
1. **Intersection for the Arts** (intersectionfortheart.org)
   - SF-based, arts-focused
   - 8-10% fee
   - Strong track record with SFAC grants

2. **Fractured Atlas** (fracturedatlas.org)
   - National, but works with SF artists
   - 7% fee
   - Easy online application

3. **SF Arts Commission Fiscal Sponsorship Program**
   - Check if SFAC offers fiscal sponsorship for their own grants
   - Contact: sfac.grants@sfgov.org
