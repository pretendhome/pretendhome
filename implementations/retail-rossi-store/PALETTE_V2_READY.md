## KEY IMPROVEMENTS THAT WILL BE APPLIED

### From Current Deliverables → Palette V2 Output

**1. Identity Crisis Resolution**
- **Current**: Tries to be nonprofit + streetwear + incubator simultaneously
- **V2**: Clear "Cultural Platform" positioning with gallery/studio/editions as product lines

**2. Partner Economics Fix**
- **Current**: 1.8% capture rate (not viable per BCG)
- **V2**: Network fee (5% retail) + platform fee (15% online) + brokerage (25%) = 10-15% capture

**3. Growth Rate Moderation**
- **Current**: 99% Year 2 growth (venture-scale, not realistic)
- **V2**: 35-45% annual growth (exceptional but achievable)

**4. Marty Cagan Voice**
- **Current**: "We will build a platform..." (solution-first, aspirational)
- **V2**: "Artists are exploited by galleries taking 50-60%. We tested a 50/50 model with 80 artists. Creative Growth proves it works at scale." (problem-first, evidence-based)

**5. Evidence Citations**
- **Current**: Claims without sources
- **V2**: Every claim cited [Creative Growth Form 990 FY 2024], [BCG Assessment p.12], [Perplexity search 2026-02-07]

**6. Digital Strategy**
- **Current**: $10K Year 1 online (too low per BCG)
- **V2**: $6K investment in Shopify optimization, product photography, email marketing → $25-35K Year 1 target

**7. Baseline Data**
- **Current**: All projections, no actuals
- **V2**: "Must populate from POS system before submission" flagged as BLOCKING issue

## WHAT THE EXECUTION WOULD PRODUCE

### Deliverable 1: ROSSI_PRODUCT_STRATEGY_V2.docx

**Structure** (Marty Cagan voice throughout):

**1. The Customer Problem** (not "Our Vision")
- Artists are exploited: 50-60% commission, minimal career support
- No structured pathway from street art to sustainable career
- Mission District produces world-class artists but economic model hasn't evolved

**2. What We Learned** (not "What We Believe")
- Tested 50/50 split with 80 artists at 791 Valencia Street
- Creative Growth proves model works: 50 years, 140 artists, $3.26M revenue
- BCG validated: "Viable but needs identity clarity and partner economics fix"

**3. The Product** (not "The Platform")
- Cultural Platform with three product lines:
  * Rossi Gallery (retail showroom)
  * Rossi Studio (workshops, residencies, artist development)
  * Rossi Editions (limited releases, collaborations, online)

**4. How We'll Validate** (not "Our Strategy")
- 90-day validation plan: Foundation → Validation → Launch
- Pilot workshop (test discovery funnel)
- 3 artist case studies (prove pipeline works)
- First "Artist Drop" (test digital strategy)
- Measurable outcomes: $25K+ monthly revenue, 10%+ workshop conversion, 3 documented career launches

**5. The Business Model** (evidence-based, not aspirational)
- 7 revenue streams, diversified (no single >45%)
- Year 1: $745K (conservative, based on $350K retail baseline)
- Year 2-3: 35-45% annual growth (exceptional but realistic)
- Partner economics: 10-15% capture rate (network fee + platform fee + brokerage)

**6. What Could Go Wrong** (not hidden in "Risks" section)
- Artist pipeline unvalidated (highest risk) → Mitigation: Pilot workshop + case studies in 90 days
- Partner economics untested → Mitigation: First partner (Oakland) validates model before scaling
- Digital strategy underdeveloped → Mitigation: $6K investment, measurable outcomes in 60 days

**7. The Ask** (staged, milestone-based)
- $185K in 3 tranches tied to validation milestones
- Tranche 1 ($75K): Foundation (baseline data, brand system, digital optimization)
- Tranche 2 ($60K): Validation (workshop, case studies, first partner)
- Tranche 3 ($50K): Launch (content strategy, first collaboration, $25K+ monthly revenue)
