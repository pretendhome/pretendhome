# REX TASK: Revenue Model Revision Based on Creative Growth Comparable

**Agent**: Rex (Architect)  
**RIU**: Revenue model architecture revision  
**Input**: Creative Growth Form 990 data + underwriter analysis  
**Output**: Revised revenue model matching proven nonprofit structure

---

## TASK BRIEF

The underwriter identified that Rossi's revenue mix is inverted from Creative Growth's proven 50-year model:

**Current Rossi Plan**:
- Retail: $500K (64%)
- Grants: $50K (6%)

**Creative Growth Actual** (FY 2024, $3.26M total):
- Art sales: $1.06M (33%)
- Grants: $1.11M (34%)
- Programs: $1.03M (32%)

**Your task**: Redesign Rossi's Year 1 revenue model to match Creative Growth's structural proportions while maintaining $780K total target.

## DECISION TO MAKE

🚨 **ONE-WAY DOOR**: Revenue model architecture

**Options**:

### Option 1: Keep Current Model (Retail-Heavy)
- Retail: $500K (64%)
- Grants: $50K (6%)
- Other streams: $230K (30%)

**Pros**:
- Aligns with current operations (if retail is actually $400K+)
- Less grant dependency (easier to execute)

**Cons**:
- Single-point failure (retail downturn kills the model)
- Doesn't match Creative Growth's proven structure
- Underwriter flagged as "structurally fragile"

### Option 2: Flip to Grant-Heavy (Creative Growth Model)
- Retail: $350K (45%)
- Grants: $200K (26%)
- Programs: $150K (19%)
- Other: $80K (10%)

**Pros**:
- Matches Creative Growth's 50-year proven model
- Diversified (no single stream >45%)
- Grant-stabilized (retail fluctuations don't kill model)

**Cons**:
- Requires aggressive grant strategy ($250K+ applications)
- Needs grant writer (0.5 FTE, $40K)
- Higher execution complexity

### Option 3: Balanced Hybrid
- Retail: $400K (51%)
- Grants: $150K (19%)
- Programs: $130K (17%)
- Other: $100K (13%)

**Pros**:
- Moderate grant dependency
- Still diversified
- Easier to execute than Option 2

**Cons**:
- Doesn't fully match Creative Growth model
- Still retail-heavy (51%)

## GAME THEORY ANALYSIS

**Option 1 vs Option 2**:

Option 1 wins when:
- Current retail is actually $450K+ (only 11% growth needed)
- Grant landscape is hostile (NEA cuts, foundation rejections)
- Team lacks grant-writing capacity

Option 2 wins when:
- Current retail is $300K or less (need structural change anyway)
- Grant landscape is favorable (SFAC, CAC, foundations accessible)
- Creative Growth model is the anchor comparable for funders

**Weakness in Option 1 exposed by Option 2**:
- Retail-dependent models are vulnerable to SF vacancy fluctuations
- Creative Growth proves grants can be 34% of revenue reliably

**Weakness in Option 2 exposed by Option 1**:
- Grant applications take 3-6 months (cash flow timing risk)
- Requires grant-writing expertise Rossi may not have

---

## INTEGRATION ANALYSIS

**Existing decisions**:
- ✓ 50/50 artist split (both options support this)
- ✓ Three pillars (Option 2 better aligns programs as revenue stream)
- ✓ Nonprofit structure (Option 2 better matches nonprofit economics)

**Future decisions**:
- Partner expansion: Option 2 better (grants fund network development)
- Scalability: Option 2 better (Creative Growth scaled to 140 artists on this model)

**Case study patterns**:
- ✓ Diversified Revenue: Option 2 stronger (no stream >45%)
- ✓ Community-Before-Commerce: Option 2 stronger (grants prioritize mission)

---

## RECOMMENDATION

**Option 2: Flip to Grant-Heavy (Creative Growth Model)**

**Rationale**:
1. Creative Growth proves this works at scale (50 years, 140 artists, $3.26M)
2. Underwriter explicitly flagged retail-dependency as "structurally fragile"
3. Nonprofit economics favor grant-stabilized models
4. Diversification pattern requires no stream >40-45%
5. If Rossi uses Creative Growth as anchor comparable, revenue mix should match

**Risks**:
- Grant applications may fail (30-50% rejection rate)
- Requires grant writer hire ($40K Year 1)
- Cash flow timing (grants arrive Q2-Q4, not evenly)

**Mitigation**:
- Apply for $250K+ in grants to net $150-200K (account for rejections)
- Partner with fiscal sponsor's grant team (Fractured Atlas, Intersection for the Arts)
- Build 3-month cash reserve ($110K) to survive grant delays
- Start grant applications immediately (SFAC deadline Oct/Nov, CAC Jan-Mar)

## REVISED REVENUE MODEL (Option 2)

| Stream | Amount | % | Rationale |
|--------|--------|---|-----------|
| **Retail** | $350K | 45% | $4,375 gross per artist (vs CG's $7,593) — conservative |
| **Grants** | $200K | 26% | Match CG's 34% (apply for $250K+, expect 70-80% success) |
| **Workshops** | $100K | 13% | Increase volume, reduce corporate pricing to $1,500-3,000 |
| **Events** | $60K | 8% | No change from original |
| **Collaborations** | $40K | 5% | No change from original |
| **Residencies** | $20K | 3% | Conservative Year 1, scale in Year 2 |
| **Online** | $10K | 1% | Conservative until content engine built |
| **TOTAL** | **$780K** | **100%** | Same total, structurally more sustainable |

**Grant Strategy** (to net $200K):

| Source | Amount | Probability | Expected Value |
|--------|--------|-------------|----------------|
| SFAC Individual (2 artists) | $50K | 50% | $25K |
| SFAC Organizational | $25K | 40% | $10K |
| CAC Organizational | $15K | 35% | $5K |
| Zellerbach Foundation | $25K | 30% | $7.5K |
| Haas Fund | $50K | 25% | $12.5K |
| SF Foundation | $50K | 20% | $10K |
| Private donors (residencies) | $50K | 60% | $30K |
| **Total Applied** | **$265K** | | **$100K expected** |

**Note**: Expected value is $100K, not $200K. To net $200K, need to apply for $400K+ OR achieve higher success rates through strong applications + fiscal sponsor support.

## EXPENSE ADJUSTMENTS

| Category | Original | Revised | Change |
|----------|----------|---------|--------|
| Artist Payments | $356K | $245K | -$111K (scales with $350K retail vs $500K) |
| Personnel | $241K | $280K | +$39K (add grant writer 0.5 FTE) |
| Grant Application Costs | $0 | $15K | +$15K (fiscal sponsor fees, 8% of $200K) |
| Content Production | $60K | $40K | -$20K (phase in over Year 1) |
| **TOTAL** | **$855K** | **$855K** | Net zero (reallocated) |

---

## 🚨 ONE-WAY DOOR CONFIRMATION REQUIRED

**Decision**: Flip revenue model from retail-heavy (64%) to grant-heavy (26% grants, 45% retail)

**This is irreversible because**:
- Grant applications take 3-6 months (can't pivot mid-year)
- Hiring grant writer commits $40K
- Fiscal sponsor relationship requires commitment
- Funder expectations set by initial applications

**Human must confirm**:
1. Are you willing to apply for $250K+ in grants?
2. Can you hire/partner for grant writing capacity?
3. Do you accept 3-6 month grant timing risk?
4. Will you use Creative Growth as anchor comparable?

**If YES**: Proceed with Option 2  
**If NO**: Revert to Option 1 or 3, but acknowledge underwriter concerns
