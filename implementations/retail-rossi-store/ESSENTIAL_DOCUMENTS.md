**Next Step**: Final decision by Rossi team

---

## 🎯 THE 3 CRITICAL ASSESSMENTS (Read These First)

### 1. **BCG_PRODUCT_ASSESSMENT.md** ⭐ **MOST IMPORTANT**
- **Who**: Product Manager (BCG Fashion & Retail Practice)
- **Score**: CONDITIONAL GO
- **Length**: 41 pages
- **Key Finding**: "Rossi is viable but has identity crisis — nonprofit, streetwear brand, or artist incubator?"
- **Critical Insights**:
  * Brand identity confusion is the central strategic problem
  * Partner network economics don't work (1.8% capture rate)
  * Digital strategy is underdeveloped ($10K Year 1 too low)
  * 99% Year 2 growth is venture-scale, not realistic
  * Artist pipeline is entirely unvalidated (highest risk)
- **Verdict**: CONDITIONAL GO with 7 conditions
- **Read**: Sections 2 (Situation Assessment), 11 (Recommendations), 12 (Go/No-Go), 13 (90-Day Plan)

### 2. **UNDERWRITER_AUDIT_FINAL.md** ⭐ **SECOND MOST IMPORTANT**
- **Who**: Underwriter (funding decision)
- **Score**: 82/100 (conditional pass)
- **Length**: 24 pages
- **Key Finding**: "Analysis is not evidence. Needs real data."
- **Critical Insights**:
  * No actual baseline data (all projections, no actuals)
  * No artist case studies (pipeline unproven)
  * Grant numbers inconsistent ($200K vs $100K vs $30K across documents)
  * Section 8 (Financial Projections) not written
  * Year 2-3 growth rates not credible (99% / 74%)
- **Verdict**: Conditional approval at $150K (not $185-200K requested)
- **Read**: Sections 3 (Condition-by-Condition Audit), 5 (What's Still Wrong), 6 (Fundability Assessment)

### 3. **UNDERWRITER_READY_REPORT.md**
- **Who**: Business Manager (revised business plan)
- **Score**: 82/100 (improved from 79/100)
- **Length**: 25 pages
- **Key Finding**: "Revenue model flipped to match Creative Growth structure"
- **Critical Insights**:
  * Creative Growth as anchor comparable (50 years, 140 artists, $1M+ art sales)
  * Revenue model revised: 45% retail, 26% grants (from 64% retail, 6% grants)
  * Funding ask increased to $185-200K (covers Month 17 cash crisis)
  * Governance simplified to 5-7 member board Year 1
- **Verdict**: Ready for underwriter review (but underwriter found gaps)
- **Read**: Executive Summary, ONE-WAY DOOR #1 (Revenue Model), Section 6 (Revenue Model)

- Underwriter's timeline: 2-3 weeks to populate data
- Business Manager's timeline: 6 weeks to full validation

### Decision 5: Identity?

## 🎯 BOTTOM LINE

**Three experts. Three assessments. Same conclusion**:

✅ **The vision is strong**  
✅ **The model is viable**  
✅ **The structure is sound**

1. Actual baseline data (1-2 days to pull from POS)
2. Artist case studies (2-3 weeks to interview and document)
3. Brand identity clarity (4 weeks to resolve)
4. Digital strategy execution ($6K, 4 weeks)
5. Partner economics restructure (before any partnerships)

**Timeline to fundable**: 90 days (Product Manager's plan)

**Funding recommendation**: $185K staged in 3 tranches
- Tranche 1: $75K (Foundation — Days 1-30)
- Tranche 2: $60K (Validation — Days 31-60)
- Tranche 3: $50K (Launch — Days 61-90)
