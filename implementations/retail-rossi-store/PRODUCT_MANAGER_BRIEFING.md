# PRODUCT MANAGER BRIEFING PROMPT
## Rossi Mission Project: Fashion Brand & Digital Product Viability Assessment

**Your Role**: Product Manager with expertise in fashion brands and digital product rollout  
**Your Task**: Evaluate business viability and product rollout strategy  
**Decision Required**: Is this a viable business plan? Is the product rollout executable?  
**Timeline**: Review materials, assess viability, provide go/no-go recommendation

---

## YOUR EXPERTISE IS NEEDED FOR

You are NOT being asked to validate the nonprofit structure, financial projections, or grant strategy — the Business Manager and Underwriter have done that work.

**You ARE being asked to evaluate**:

1. **Brand Viability**: Can Rossi Mission scale as a fashion/streetwear brand?
2. **Product-Market Fit**: Does the 3-pillar model (events, workshops, residencies) create a sustainable product ecosystem?
3. **Digital Rollout**: Is the online/e-commerce strategy executable?
4. **Artist Pipeline**: Does the talent discovery → development → launch model work as a product system?
5. **Partner Network**: Is the multi-city gallery network model operationally viable?
6. **Content Strategy**: Can content-driven discovery actually drive revenue?
7. **Scarcity Economics**: Will the 250 SKU cap / limited collaboration model protect brand value?

**Your lens**: Fashion brand strategy, product rollout, digital commerce, talent management, brand partnerships

## READING ORDER & PURPOSE

### PHASE 1: UNDERSTAND THE CONTEXT (30 minutes)

**1. README_FINAL.md** (5 min)
- **Purpose**: Navigation guide
- **What to extract**: Document structure, what's been done, what's missing
- **Your focus**: Understand the package organization

**2. UNDERWRITER_AUDIT_FINAL.md** (15 min) ⭐ **READ THIS FIRST**
- **Purpose**: Independent critical assessment
- **What to extract**: 
  * Score: 82/100 (conditional pass)
  * What's validated: Creative Growth comparable, revenue model structure, governance
  * What's missing: Actual baseline data, artist case studies, grant reconciliation
  * Critical gaps: No Section 8 (Financial Projections), grant numbers inconsistent
- **Your focus**: 
  * Section "What's Still Wrong" (page 12-13)
  * "Honest Fundability Assessment" (page 14-16)
  * The underwriter is saying "good plan, needs real data" — you need to assess if the PLAN itself is viable

**3. EXECUTIVE_DECISION_BRIEF.md** (10 min)
- **Purpose**: Business Manager's summary for Rossi team
- **What to extract**: The 5 critical gaps, 3 critical fixes, 7 questions for Rossi team
- **Your focus**: 
  * "The 5 Critical Gaps" (pages 2-6)
  * Creative Growth as anchor comparable
  * Does the Business Manager understand fashion/streetwear dynamics?

---

### PHASE 2: EVALUATE THE BUSINESS MODEL (45 minutes)

**4. UNDERWRITER_READY_REPORT.md** (30 min) — **PRIMARY BUSINESS PLAN**
- **Purpose**: Complete revised business plan
- **What to extract**: Revenue model, product strategy, expansion plan
- **Your focus as Product Manager**:

**Section 6: Revenue Model (pages 8-15)**
- **Evaluate**: 7 revenue streams — are these realistic for a fashion/streetwear brand?
- **Key questions**:
  * Retail ($350K): Can a single Valencia Street location generate this with 250 SKU cap?
  * Workshops ($100K): Is $1,500-3,000 corporate workshop pricing realistic for graffiti art?
  * Brand Collaborations ($40K): Only 2-3 per year — is this enough? Or is scarcity the right strategy?
  * Online ($10K Year 1): This seems LOW for a streetwear brand. Is the digital strategy underdeveloped?
- **Product Manager lens**: Does this revenue mix make sense for a fashion brand, or is it too nonprofit-focused?

**Section "50/50 Split Mechanics" (page 14)**
- **Evaluate**: Artist payments are 27% of total revenue, not 50%
- **Key question**: Is this framing misleading to artists? Will this create retention issues?

**Section "Year 1-3 Revenue Projections" (page 15)**
- **Evaluate**: Year 2 $1.55M (+99%), Year 3 $2.7M (+74%)
- **Key question**: The underwriter flagged this as "venture-scale growth for a nonprofit." As a Product Manager, is this achievable for a fashion brand expanding to 5-7 cities?

**ONE-WAY DOOR #1: Revenue Model Revision (pages 4-6)**
- **Evaluate**: Flip from 64% retail to 45% retail, 26% grants
- **Key question**: Fashion brands don't typically rely on grants. Is this a sustainable model for a streetwear brand, or does it create mission drift?

**5. VALIDATED_COMPARABLES_RESEARCH.md** (15 min)
- **Purpose**: Creative Growth Form 990 analysis + market research
- **What to extract**: 
  * Creative Growth: $3.26M revenue, 140 artists, 50/50 split, 50 years
  * SF retail market: Valencia Street 2-4% vacancy (healthy)
  * Workshop pricing: $1,500-3,000 is market rate
- **Your focus**:
  * "Finding 1: Creative Growth" (pages 1-3) — Is this a valid comparable for a FASHION brand? Creative Growth serves artists with disabilities (different market). Rossi is graffiti/streetwear (different aesthetic).
  * "Finding 6: Pareto Distribution" (page 8) — Top 10% of artists generate 60-70% of sales. As a Product Manager, how do you manage a roster where 48 of 80 artists earn <$1,000/year?

### PHASE 3: ASSESS PRODUCT ROLLOUT VIABILITY (30 minutes)

**6. VISUALS PACKAGE** (folder: `/visuals-for-product-manager/`) — **CREATED FOR YOU**
- **Purpose**: Visual analysis of product strategy, brand positioning, and rollout plan
- **What's included** (see detailed list below):
  * Revenue model comparison (Current vs Revised vs Creative Growth)
  * Artist pipeline funnel (Workshops → Residencies → Roster → Career Launch)
  * Geographic expansion roadmap (SF → LA/Oakland → NYC/Seattle/Portland)
  * SKU management strategy (250 cap per location, breadth vs depth)
  * Brand collaboration framework (3-5 per year, approval process)
  * Cash flow danger zones (Month 7-11, Month 17)
  * Partner network economics (How money flows between Rossi and partners)
  * Content-driven discovery model (How documentation drives sales)
- **Your focus**: Do these product strategies make operational sense?

**7. Remediation Folder** (reference as needed)
- **condition-2-monthly-cashflow.md**: Month-by-month cash flow (18 months)
  * **Your focus**: Months 7-11 and Month 17 are cash danger zones. As a Product Manager, can you launch products/programs on this timeline?
- **condition-3-pipeline-validation.md**: Artist case study templates
  * **Your focus**: The pipeline is the product. Without real artist data, can you validate product-market fit?
- **condition-4-simplified-governance.md**: Phased governance model
  * **Your focus**: 5-7 member board Year 1. Is this enough operational capacity to execute a multi-city rollout?

---

### PHASE 4: EVALUATE DIGITAL & BRAND STRATEGY (20 minutes)

**8. Original Research** (reference as needed)
- **research/argy/task-1-global-markets.md**: Graffiti art market ($6.8B, 8.2% CAGR)
  * **Your focus**: Is this market real? Or is it inflated by Banksy/Kaws outliers?
- **research/argy/task-5-comparable-organizations.md**: Supreme, Stüssy, ALIFE, GX1000 case studies
  * **Your focus**: These are streetwear brands, not nonprofits. What lessons apply to Rossi?
- **research/argy/task-6-revenue-models.md**: Revenue stream analysis
  * **Your focus**: Music industry "expanded rights" model (merch, sponsorships, branding) = $3.5B. Can this apply to visual artists?

**9. Original Business Plan Sections** (presentation/yuty/ folder)
- **section-4-competitive-landscape.md**: Competitive positioning
  * **Your focus**: Who is Rossi actually competing with? Traditional galleries? Streetwear brands? Online marketplaces?
- **section-5-artist-pipeline.md**: Artist development model
  * **Your focus**: Is "signature style + personal champion + documentation = career launch" a real formula? Or is it survivorship bias (Chito/Barry McGee)?
- **section-10-roadmap.md**: Expansion roadmap
  * **Your focus**: SF Year 1, LA/Oakland Year 2, NYC/Seattle/Portland Year 3. Is this timeline realistic for a fashion brand?

## KEY QUESTIONS FOR YOUR ASSESSMENT

### Brand Viability
1. **Is Rossi a fashion brand or a nonprofit?** The revenue model is 26% grants. Fashion brands don't rely on grants. Does this create identity confusion?
2. **Can scarcity economics work for emerging artists?** Supreme can limit drops because they're Supreme. Can Rossi limit SKUs before they're established?
3. **Is the 50/50 split sustainable?** Artist payments are 27% of total revenue. Traditional fashion brands pay designers 5-10%. Is 27% too high to scale?

### Product-Market Fit
4. **Is the 3-pillar model (events, workshops, residencies) a product or a program?** Programs are costs. Products are revenue. Which is this?
5. **Does the artist pipeline actually work?** The only example is "Maria" (fictional). Without real case studies, can you validate product-market fit?
6. **Is $10K Year 1 online revenue realistic?** Streetwear brands are digital-first. $10K seems LOW. Is the digital strategy underdeveloped?

### Operational Viability
7. **Can you execute a 5-7 city rollout in 3 years?** Year 2 projects 99% growth. Year 3 projects 74% growth. Is this operationally feasible?
8. **Is the partner network model viable?** Partners keep their revenue, Rossi earns 20% finder's fees. Is this enough to sustain Rossi's operations?
9. **Can you survive Months 7-11 and Month 17?** Cash flow shows danger zones. Can you launch products on this timeline?

### Digital & Content Strategy
10. **Does content-driven discovery actually drive sales?** GX1000 model is cited. But GX1000 is a skate crew with cult following. Can this work for emerging graffiti artists?
11. **Is the online strategy executable?** $10K Year 1, $45K Year 2, $80K Year 3. For a streetwear brand, this seems underdeveloped. What's missing?
12. **Can you build a brand on Instagram?** The plan assumes social media drives discovery. Is this realistic in 2026?
