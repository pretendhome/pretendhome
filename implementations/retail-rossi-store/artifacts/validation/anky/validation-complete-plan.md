### Evidence Quality Assessment

**Strength**: HIGH
- Every major claim (market size, organizational structure, governance model, revenue projections, case study lessons) is grounded in research
- Multiple sources corroborate key findings (e.g., grant landscape validated by task-4 + Rex architecture)
- Specific data points cited (e.g., "$6.8B market, 8.2% CAGR" from task-1)

**Weaknesses**:
- 4 claims rely on industry assumptions rather than research (corporate workshop pricing, social media growth rates, conversion rates)
- These are operational metrics that will be validated through execution, not research

**Recommendation**: Add disclaimer to weak evidence claims: "Target based on industry benchmarks, to be validated through operations"

## 2. Case Study Pattern Validation

### Pattern 1: Scarcity Economics (Supreme)

**Where Applied**:
- Section 3 (Market Analysis): SKU caps, limited edition strategy
- Section 4 (Competitive Landscape): Supreme lesson, scarcity vs. growth tension
- Section 6 (Revenue Model): 250 SKU cap per location, limited collaborations (3-5/year)
- Section 7 (Operations): Inventory management, replenishment strategy
- Section 9 (Risk Analysis): Risk 7 - Scarcity vs. growth tension

**Validation**: ✓ APPLIED CORRECTLY
- SKU caps enforced (250 per location)
- Breadth over depth expansion (more locations, not more inventory)
- Limited collaborations (3-5/year, no mass-market deals)
- Artist advisory council enforces scarcity (governance prevents over-commercialization)

**Evidence**: "Scarcity and growth are really oppositional" [Research: task-5, Supreme] cited multiple times

### Pattern 2: Community-Before-Commerce (Stüssy International Tribe)

**Where Applied**:
- Section 2 (Mission/Vision): Core value #2, community-first principle
- Section 4 (Competitive Landscape): Stüssy Tribe model, partner criteria
- Section 6 (Revenue Model): No franchise fees, cultural fit over revenue
- Section 7 (Operations): Partner selection criteria (MUST HAVE: cultural fit)
- Section 10 (Roadmap): Partner vetting process, artist advisory council approval

**Validation**: ✓ APPLIED CORRECTLY
- Partner galleries selected for cultural fit, not revenue potential
- No franchise fees (community-first, not profit extraction)
- Artist advisory council approves all partners
- Sliding-scale workshops (community access prioritized)

**Evidence**: Stüssy International Tribe model [Research: task-5] cited as foundation for partner network

### Pattern 3: Content-Driven Discovery (GX1000)

**Where Applied**:
- Section 3 (Market Analysis): Documentation as discovery engine
- Section 5 (Artist Pipeline): Stage 3 - Documentation & Visibility
- Section 6 (Revenue Model): Content production as operational function
- Section 7 (Operations): Content production $60K-$100K/year budget
- Section 9 (Risk Analysis): Risk 9 - Content production costs

**Validation**: ✓ APPLIED CORRECTLY
- Content production is operational function (not marketing expense)
- $60K-$100K annual budget (24-36 artist stories Year 1)
- Distribution across multiple channels (Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, newsletter)
- Documentation enables discovery ("travels globally within hours")

**Evidence**: GX1000 model [Research: task-5] + "digital documentation allows murals to travel globally" [Research: task-1] cited

### Pattern 4: Artist Career Pipeline (Chito → Barry McGee)

**Where Applied**:
- Section 1 (Executive Summary): Solution overview, three-pillar integration
- Section 2 (Mission/Vision): Core value #5, integrated career development
- Section 4 (Competitive Landscape): Chito and Barry McGee trajectories
- Section 5 (Artist Pipeline): Complete section dedicated to pipeline
- Section 10 (Roadmap): Career launch metrics

- Workshops develop signature style
- Residencies provide champions (mentors)
- Content creates documentation
- Example "Maria" demonstrates 12-month pipeline

**Evidence**: Chito trajectory [Research: task-5] + Barry McGee trajectory [Research: task-5] cited as validation

### Pattern 5: Diversified Revenue (6-7 streams minimum)

**Where Applied**:
- Section 1 (Executive Summary): Financial highlights, 7-stream model
- Section 6 (Revenue Model): Complete section, 7 streams detailed
- Section 8 (Financial Projections): Revenue breakdown by stream
- Section 9 (Risk Analysis): Diversification as risk mitigation

**Validation**: ✓ APPLIED CORRECTLY
- 7 revenue streams (retail, workshops, grants, events, collaborations, residencies, online)
- No single stream >64% Year 1, >60% Year 2, >57% Year 3
- Earned revenue >80% (not grant-dependent)
- Diversification protects against single-source failure

**Evidence**: "Successful organizations have 5-7 revenue streams, never just one" [Research: task-6] cited

### Pattern 6: Distributed Governance (ALIFE/FA cautionary tale)

**Where Applied**:
- Section 1 (Executive Summary): Governance model overview
- Section 2 (Mission/Vision): Core value #5, distributed decision-making
- Section 4 (Competitive Landscape): ALIFE failure mode (founder dependency)
- Section 7 (Operations): Dual-board structure (14-17 decision-makers)
- Section 9 (Risk Analysis): Risk 5 - Founder dependency

- "80% of residents secure gallery representation within 12 months" (Section 5)
- "10-15% workshop conversion rate" (Section 5, 10)

**Revision**: Add footnote or inline disclaimer:
> "Target based on industry benchmarks and comparable programs. Will be validated through Year 1 operations and adjusted in Year 2 planning."

**Impact**: Increases transparency, manages funder expectations

### MEDIUM (Could Improve)

**None** - No medium-priority issues detected

### LOW (Nice to Have)
