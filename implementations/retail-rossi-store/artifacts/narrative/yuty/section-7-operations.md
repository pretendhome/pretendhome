# Section 7: Operations Plan

**Rossi Mission Project Business Plan**  
**Date**: February 2026

---

## Organizational Structure: Fiscal Sponsorship Hybrid

### Two-Entity Model

**Rossi Mission Project** (501(c)(3) via fiscal sponsor):
- **Operations**: Workshops, residencies, community events, content/documentation
- **Revenue**: Grants, workshop fees, residency sponsorships, donations
- **Expenses**: Artist stipends, program costs, content production
- **Fiscal Sponsor**: Fractured Atlas, Intersection for the Arts, or California Lawyers for the Arts

**Rossi Gallery LLC** (for-profit):
- **Operations**: Retail sales (gallery + online), brand collaborations, merchandise
- **Revenue**: Product sales, licensing, collaborations
- **Expenses**: COGS, artist payments (50/50 split), rent, operations

**Rationale**: Preserves 50/50 artist profit-split (through LLC) while enabling grant access (through 501(c)(3)), addressing IRS "private benefit" constraint [Research: task-2-nonprofit-vs-forprofit.md].

---

## Governance Structure: Dual-Board Model

### Governing Board (5 members)
**Composition**:
- 2 nonprofit/business expertise (grant writing, finance, legal)
- 2 artists (from Rossi roster, rotating 2-year terms)
- 1 community representative (Mission District resident/business owner)

**Responsibilities**:
- Fiduciary oversight (budget approval, financial reporting, legal compliance)
- Fiscal sponsor coordination
- Fundraising strategy
- Executive director hiring/oversight (if/when hired)

**Meets**: Quarterly

### Artist Advisory Council (9-12 members)
**Composition**:
- Majority from Rossi's 80+ artist roster (elected by artists, 2-year terms)
- 2-3 external artists (for outside perspective)

**Responsibilities**:
- Artist selection (who joins Rossi roster)
- Curatorial decisions (exhibitions, events)
- Partner gallery vetting (cultural fit assessment)
- Workshop/residency program design
- Brand collaboration approval (what aligns with Rossi values)

**Meets**: Monthly

### Decision-Making Protocol
- **Governing Board decides**: Budget, legal, compliance, fundraising, sponsor coordination
- **Artist Advisory Council decides**: Artist selection, curation, partner vetting, program design, brand collaborations
- **Both bodies consult**: Strategic direction, expansion decisions, major partnerships

**Rationale**: Balances artist voice (advisory council) with nonprofit expertise (governing board), eliminates founder dependency (14-17 decision-makers) [Research: task-3-governance-models.md, dual-board model].

## Artist Onboarding & Management

### Selection Process

**Step 1: Application/Referral**
- Artist submits portfolio OR existing artist refers
- Open call quarterly

**Step 2: Artist Advisory Council Review**
- Evaluates artistic quality, cultural fit, career stage
- Votes on acceptance (majority required)

**Step 3: Trial Period**
- 3-month trial (artist exhibits work, no long-term commitment)
- Rossi and artist assess fit

**Step 4: Full Roster**
- After trial, artist joins full roster (2-year renewable contract)

### Selection Criteria
- **Artistic Quality**: Distinctive style, technical skill, creative vision
- **Cultural Fit**: Graffiti/street art roots, community-embedded, mission-aligned
- **Career Stage**: Emerging to mid-career (not established museum artists)
- **Geographic Diversity**: Represent multiple neighborhoods, cities (as network grows)
- **Medium Diversity**: Murals, canvas, sculpture, digital, mixed media

### Contract Terms
- **Duration**: 2 years, renewable
- **Exclusivity**: Non-exclusive (artists can sell elsewhere)
- **Profit Split**: 50/50 on retail sales (after COGS)
- **IP Rights**: Artist retains all IP, Rossi gets license to reproduce for marketing only
- **Termination**: Either party can terminate with 30 days notice

### Artist Payments

- **Workshops**: Per workshop, paid within 30 days (60% of revenue)
- **Collaborations**: Per project, 50% upfront, 50% on completion (70% of total)

## Inventory Management (Scarcity Economics)

### SKU Limits (Per Location)
- **SF Flagship**: 250 SKUs max
- **Partner Locations**: 200-300 SKUs recommended
- **Rationale**: "Scarcity and growth are really oppositional" [Research: task-5-comparable-organizations.md, Supreme]

### Inventory Mix
- **Originals**: 30-40% of SKUs ($500-$3,000+ each)
- **Limited Edition Prints**: 30-40% of SKUs ($100-$500 each)
- **Merchandise**: 20-30% of SKUs ($15-$100 each)
- **Collaborations**: 5-10% of SKUs (limited releases)

### Replenishment Strategy
- **Originals**: One-of-a-kind, not replenished (scarcity)
- **Prints**: Limited editions (50-200 prints), not reprinted once sold out
- **Merchandise**: Seasonal releases (Spring, Fall), limited quantities
- **Collaborations**: Drop model (limited release, no restock)

### Expansion Strategy
- **Add Locations, Not SKUs**: Network grows to 10-15 locations, each with 200-300 SKUs (breadth over depth)
- **Add Artists, Not Inventory**: Roster grows to 150-200 artists, but each location shows 20-30 at a time (rotation)

### Rationale
"Documentation is the discovery engine" [Research: task-1-global-markets.md, task-5-comparable-organizations.md, GX1000 model]. Content is operational function, not marketing cost.
