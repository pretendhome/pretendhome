# Section 10: Expansion Roadmap

**Rossi Mission Project Business Plan**  
**Date**: February 2026

---

## Overview: Phased 5-Year Expansion

Rossi's expansion follows a **phased approach**: prove model at scale (Year 1) → pilot partner network (Year 2) → scale nationally (Year 3-5). Each phase has clear milestones, success criteria, and go/no-go decision points.

## Decision Gates & Pivot Points

### Year 1 → Year 2 Decision Gate

**Go Criteria**: 80%+ of Year 1 success criteria met
**No-Go Response**: Hold at SF flagship, refine model for 6-12 months, reassess
**Pivot Options**: 
- Focus on online sales (reduce dependence on physical gallery)
- Shift to workshop-heavy model (if workshops outperform retail)
- Partner with existing gallery network (if building from scratch too slow)

### Year 2 → Year 3 Decision Gate

**Go Criteria**: 80%+ of Year 2 success criteria met, 2+ partners operational
**No-Go Response**: Hold at 2-3 partners, refine partner model, reassess
**Pivot Options**:
- Shift to hybrid model (Rossi-owned flagships in key markets)
- Reduce partner count (focus on 3-5 high-quality partners, not 10-15)
- Franchise model (if partners want more structure/support)

### Year 3 → Year 4-5 Decision Gate

**Go Criteria**: Sustainability achieved (positive margin, reserve fund building, 5+ partners operational)
**No-Go Response**: Hold at 5-7 partners, optimize operations, reassess
**Pivot Options**:
- Consolidate network (remove underperforming partners, focus on top performers)
- Shift to technology platform (build software for other artist collectives)
- International expansion (if US market saturated)

## Conclusion: Measured, Mission-Driven Growth

Rossi's expansion is **measured** (phased approach, clear decision gates) and **mission-driven** (artist empowerment, community-first, scarcity economics guide every decision).

**Growth philosophy**: Scale what works, pause what doesn't, pivot when necessary. Never sacrifice mission for growth.

**The goal is not to be the biggest** (Supreme's mistake) **but to be the best** (Stüssy's success): Prove that artist-first economics work at scale, create replicable model for other artist collectives, launch 100+ artist careers annually.

**By 2030, Rossi will have demonstrated**: Artist empowerment and financial sustainability are not opposing forces - they are mutually reinforcing when the system is designed correctly.
