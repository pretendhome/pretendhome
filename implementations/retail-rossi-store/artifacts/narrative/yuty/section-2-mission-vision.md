# Section 2: Mission & Vision

**Rossi Mission Project Business Plan**  
**Date**: February 2026

---

## Mission Statement

Rossi Mission Project empowers graffiti artists to build sustainable creative careers through an artist-first economic model (50/50 profit-sharing), integrated career development programs (workshops, residencies, content documentation), and a collaborative gallery network that prioritizes cultural authenticity over commercial growth.

We exist to prove that artist empowerment and financial sustainability are not opposing forces - they are mutually reinforcing when the system is designed correctly.

---

## Vision Statement

By 2030, Rossi Mission Project will operate a national network of 10-15 artist-first galleries, representing 150-200 graffiti artists, and launching 100+ professional careers annually through our integrated pipeline model.

We envision a future where:
- Graffiti artists earn living wages from their work without sacrificing creative control
- Emerging artists have clear pathways from street art to professional careers
- Gallery networks operate as collaborative communities, not extractive corporations
- Street art culture is preserved and celebrated by those who created it, not appropriated by outsiders

Rossi will be recognized as the model that proved artist-first economics work at scale.

## Core Values

### 1. Artist Empowerment Over Profit Maximization

**What this means**: Artists receive 50% of retail sales (after cost of goods sold) - double the industry standard where galleries take 50-60% commission [Research: task-5-comparable-organizations.md]. Artists retain 100% of IP rights. Artists have formal voice in governance through artist advisory council (9-12 elected members). Individual artists can veto brand collaborations even if council approves.

**Why this matters**: The traditional gallery model treats artists as suppliers, not partners. Rossi treats artists as co-creators of value who deserve majority economic benefit and decision-making power.

**In practice**: When Rossi earns $100 from selling an artist's print (after $20 production cost), the artist receives $40 and Rossi receives $40. Traditional galleries would give the artist $20-$30 and keep $50-$60.

### 2. Community-First, Commerce Second

**What this means**: Partner galleries are selected for cultural fit, not revenue potential. No franchise fees (community-first, not profit extraction). Artist advisory council approves all partners. Workshops use sliding scale ($50-$150) so Mission District residents can afford. Residencies are free to artists (100% sponsored).

**Why this matters**: Following Stüssy's International Tribe model, cultural networks built on shared values are more durable than corporate expansion built on profit extraction [Research: task-5-comparable-organizations.md, Stüssy model]. Community trust cannot be bought - it must be earned through consistent action.

**In practice**: Rossi will reject lucrative partnerships (fast fashion brands, gentrification-driving developers) if they conflict with community values. Revenue opportunity cost is acceptable when cultural integrity is at stake.

### 3. Scarcity Economics (Quality Over Growth)

**What this means**: Cap inventory at 250 SKUs per location. Limit brand collaborations to 3-5 per year. Expand through new locations (breadth), not more inventory per location (depth). Limited edition prints are never reprinted once sold out.

**Why this matters**: "Scarcity and growth are really oppositional" [Research: task-5-comparable-organizations.md, Supreme]. Supreme destroyed brand value through over-expansion post-VF Corp acquisition. Rossi chooses scarcity to protect long-term value.

**In practice**: When a print edition of 100 sells out, Rossi does not reprint - even if demand remains high. When approached by Target for mass-market collaboration, Rossi declines - even if the deal is worth $500K. Scarcity protects artist value.

### 4. Cultural Preservation (Mission District Roots)

**What this means**: Rossi is embedded in San Francisco's Mission District graffiti community, not an outsider extracting value. 791 Valencia Street location is cultural anchor. Artists represented are primarily from Bay Area, with expansion prioritizing local artists in each new market.

**Why this matters**: Gentrification and cultural appropriation occur when outsiders extract value from communities without giving back. Rossi is community-led, ensuring street art culture is preserved by those who created it.

**In practice**: Partner galleries must demonstrate community embeddedness (not gentrification drivers). Artists must have authentic connection to graffiti culture (not fine artists appropriating street aesthetics). Revenue generated in each city stays in that city (local artists, local operations).

### 5. Integrated Career Development (Pipeline, Not Transactions)

**What this means**: The three pillars (workshops, residencies, events) form integrated career pipeline, not separate programs. Workshops discover talent → Residencies provide champions and documentation → Events showcase work → Artists launch careers.

**Why this matters**: Traditional galleries offer wall space but no career development. Artists must navigate alone. Rossi applies the proven Chito → Barry McGee trajectory: signature style + personal champion + documentation = career launch [Research: task-5-comparable-organizations.md].

**In practice**: Workshop participant "Maria" develops signature style (Month 1-3) → Joins roster trial (Month 4-6) → Selected for residency with mentor "Carlos" (Month 7-9) → Solo exhibition (Month 10) → Secures gallery representation and brand collaboration (Month 11-12). This is the Rossi model.

## Theory of Change

### The Problem We Address

Talented graffiti artists remain economically vulnerable because the traditional gallery system extracts value without providing career support. Three barriers prevent artist success:

1. **Economic Exploitation**: Galleries take 50-60% commission, leaving artists with insufficient income
2. **Lack of Career Pathway**: No structured development from emerging to established artist
3. **Cultural Disconnection**: Galleries prioritize profit over community, leading to gentrification

### Our Intervention

Rossi provides three integrated interventions:

1. **Economic Fairness**: 50/50 profit-split ensures artists earn living wages
2. **Career Pipeline**: Workshops → Residencies → Content creates structured pathway
3. **Community Embeddedness**: Artist governance, cultural fit criteria, Mission District roots

### The Mechanism of Change

**Short-term (0-12 months)**:
- Artists earn 2x industry standard from sales (50% vs. 25-30%)
- Workshop participants develop signature styles (10-15% join Rossi roster)
- Residency artists gain mentors, network connections, professional documentation

**Medium-term (1-3 years)**:
- Artists launch professional careers (gallery representation, brand collaborations, museum exhibitions)
- Partner network grows to 5-7 galleries (LA, Oakland, NYC, Seattle, Portland)
- 100-200 artists supported annually through workshops, residencies, exhibitions

**Long-term (3-5 years)**:
- National network of 10-15 galleries representing 150-200 artists
- 100+ artist career launches annually (from workshop participant to professional)
- Model replicable by other artist collectives (open-source partner playbook)

### Measuring Impact

**Artist Economic Outcomes**:
- Average artist income from Rossi sales (target: $5K-$15K/year per active artist)
- Artists earning living wage from art (target: 20-30% of roster by Year 3)
- Artist retention rate (target: 80% year-over-year)

**Career Development Outcomes**:
- Workshop participants joining roster (target: 10-15% conversion)
- Residency artists securing gallery representation (target: 80% within 12 months)
- Artists landing brand collaborations (target: 30-40% of roster annually)

**Community Impact**:
- Mission District residents served through sliding-scale workshops (target: 500+ annually)
- Free residencies provided (target: 6-10 annually Year 1, 60-150 annually Year 3 network-wide)
- Artist stories documented and shared (target: 24-36 annually Year 1, 240-540 annually Year 3 network-wide)

**Network Growth**:
- Partner galleries added (target: 2-3 Year 2, 5-7 Year 3, 10-15 Year 5)
- Geographic markets served (target: SF Year 1, +LA/Oakland Year 2, +NYC/Seattle/Portland Year 3)
- Total artists represented (target: 80+ Year 1, 120+ Year 2, 150-200 Year 3)

### Why This Approach Works

**Evidence from comparable organizations**:
- **Stüssy International Tribe**: Cultural network built on shared values scaled globally while maintaining authenticity [Research: task-5-comparable-organizations.md]
- **Chito → Barry McGee**: Signature style + personal champion + documentation = career launch [Research: task-5-comparable-organizations.md]
- **GX1000**: Content-driven discovery (documentation travels globally, drives demand) [Research: task-5-comparable-organizations.md]

**Evidence from research**:
- Street art market growing 8.2% annually, institutional legitimization accelerating [Research: task-1-global-markets.md]
- Artist collectives with 5-7 diversified revenue streams are sustainable; single-stream models fail [Research: task-6-revenue-models.md]
- SF Arts Commission and California Arts Council provide stable grant funding ($10.4M awarded 2025-2026) [Research: task-4-grant-landscape.md]

**The insight**: Artist empowerment and financial sustainability are mutually reinforcing when the system is designed correctly. Fair economics attract top talent → Top talent creates valuable work → Valuable work generates revenue → Revenue funds career development → Career development launches more artists → Network effects compound.

This is not charity. This is a sustainable business model that proves artist-first economics work at scale.

## Organizational Identity

**What Rossi Is**:
- Artist-first gallery and career development platform

**What Rossi Is Not**:
- Traditional gallery (we share profits 50/50, not extract 50-60%)
- Charity (we are financially sustainable, not dependent on donations)
- Corporate brand (we prioritize culture over growth)
- Gentrification driver (we are community-led, not outsider-led)

**Our Commitment**:
- Artists will always receive 50% of retail sales (non-negotiable)
- Artists will always have formal voice in governance (artist advisory council)
- Cultural fit will always trump revenue potential (partner selection)
- Scarcity will always be protected (inventory caps, collaboration limits)
- Mission District roots will always be honored (cultural authenticity)

These are not aspirations. These are operating principles encoded in governance structure, partner criteria, and financial model.
