## Evidence-Based Writing Protocol

### Every Claim Must Have Evidence

**Evidence markers** (use these):
```
[Research: task-X-name.md, page/section]
[Case study: Organization name, specific pattern]
[Data: Specific statistic from research]
```

**Examples**:

❌ **Bad** (no evidence):
> "The global street art market is growing rapidly and presents a massive opportunity."

✓ **Good** (evidence-backed):
> "The global street art market reached $6.8 billion in 2023 and is projected to grow at 8.2% CAGR through 2030 [Research: task-1-global-markets.md]. This growth is driven by increasing legitimization of street art in traditional galleries and rising demand from millennial collectors [Research: task-1-global-markets.md, market trends section]."

❌ **Bad** (generic):
> "Rossi's 50/50 profit-split model is unique and attractive to artists."

✓ **Good** (specific + evidence):
> "Rossi's 50/50 profit-split model directly addresses the primary pain point identified in artist interviews: traditional galleries take 50-60% commission while providing minimal career development support [Research: task-5-comparable-organizations.md, artist economics]. By combining equal profit-sharing with active career development (workshops, content creation, personal champions), Rossi creates a value proposition no comparable organization offers [Research: task-5-comparable-organizations.md, competitive analysis]."

### Case Study Pattern Application

**You must weave in these 6 patterns** (from Rex's architecture):

1. **Scarcity Economics** (Supreme lesson)
   - Use when: Explaining inventory strategy, expansion approach
   - Language: "Scarcity protects value... network expansion increases breadth (locations/artists) not depth (inventory per location)"

2. **Community-Before-Commerce** (Stüssy International Tribe)
   - Use when: Explaining partner gallery criteria, brand strategy
   - Language: "Cultural fit over revenue potential... partner galleries selected for artist community alignment"

3. **Content-Driven Discovery** (GX1000 model)
   - Use when: Explaining marketing strategy, operational budget
   - Language: "Content creation is operational function, not marketing cost... documentation is the discovery engine"

4. **Artist Career Pipeline** (Chito → Barry McGee)
   - Use when: Explaining artist development, three-pillar integration
   - Language: "Signature style + personal champion + documentation = career launch... three pillars form integrated pipeline"

5. **Diversified Revenue** (6-7 streams minimum)
   - Use when: Explaining revenue model, risk mitigation
   - Language: "Single-stream models are vulnerable... 6+ revenue streams protect against grant cancellations, retail downturns"

6. **Distributed Governance** (ALIFE/FA cautionary tale)
   - Use when: Explaining nonprofit structure, board composition
   - Language: "Single-founder models collapse when founder exits... artist-majority board eliminates founder dependency"
