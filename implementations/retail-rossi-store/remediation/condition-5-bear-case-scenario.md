# Condition 5: Bear-Case Scenario

**Purpose**: Demonstrate organizational survival at 60% of projected revenue, with specific decision triggers and action plans for multiple stress scenarios
**Date**: 2026-02-07

---

## Scenario Design Principles

The business plan projects $780K Year 1 revenue. An underwriter needs to know the organization survives at substantially lower revenue. This document models four stress scenarios:

1. **60% Revenue Scenario** (systematic underperformance)
2. **6-Month Grant Delay** (timing risk)
3. **Partner Failure Cascade** (network risk)
4. **Top Artist Departure** (talent concentration risk)

Each scenario includes: trigger conditions, financial impact, specific cost-cutting measures, decision timeline, and survival metrics.

## Scenario 1: 60% Revenue (Systematic Underperformance)

### The Scenario

Everything is 40% worse than projected. Retail is soft, workshops fill slowly, grants are smaller, collaborations are fewer. Not a single catastrophic event -- just persistent underperformance across all streams.

### Revenue at 60%

| Stream | Plan | Bear Case (60%) | Delta |
|--------|------|-----------------|-------|
| Retail | $500,000 | $300,000 | -$200,000 |
| Workshops | $80,000 | $48,000 | -$32,000 |
| Grants | $50,000 | $30,000 | -$20,000 |
| Events | $60,000 | $36,000 | -$24,000 |
| Collaborations | $40,000 | $24,000 | -$16,000 |
| Residencies | $30,000 | $18,000 | -$12,000 |
| Online | $20,000 | $12,000 | -$8,000 |
| **TOTAL** | **$780,000** | **$468,000** | **-$312,000** |

### Expense Adjustments at 60% Revenue

**Variable costs scale down automatically:**

| Category | Plan | Bear Case | Savings | Notes |
|----------|------|-----------|---------|-------|
| COGS (30% retail) | $150,000 | $90,000 | $60,000 | Automatic -- scales with retail |
| Artist pay (50% net retail) | $175,000 | $105,000 | $70,000 | Automatic -- scales with retail |
| Artist pay (workshops 60%) | $48,000 | $28,800 | $19,200 | Automatic |
| Artist pay (collabs 70%) | $28,000 | $16,800 | $11,200 | Automatic |
| Residency stipends | $30,000 | $18,000 | $12,000 | Fewer residencies |
| Fiscal sponsor fee | $5,000 | $2,400 | $2,600 | Scales with grants |
| **Variable Subtotal** | **$436,000** | **$261,000** | **$175,000** | |

**Fixed costs require deliberate cuts:**

| Category | Plan | Bear Case | Savings | Cut Description |
|----------|------|-----------|---------|-----------------|
| Rent | $120,000 | $120,000 | $0 | **Cannot cut** -- lease obligation |
| Staff: Gallery Manager | $54,000 | $54,000 | $0 | Essential -- cannot cut |
| Staff: ED (0.5 FTE) | $36,000 | $24,000 | $12,000 | Reduce to 0.33 FTE |
| Staff: Content (0.5 FTE) | $30,000 | $0 | $30,000 | **Eliminate** -- founder covers basic social |
| Staff: Workshop Coord | $12,000 | $0 | $12,000 | **Eliminate** -- founder coordinates |
| Content Production | $30,000 | $5,000 | $25,000 | iPhone only, no professional production |
| Technology | $10,000 | $6,000 | $4,000 | Drop to free tiers where possible |
| Marketing | $20,000 | $5,000 | $15,000 | Organic only, no paid ads |
| Insurance/Legal/Acctg | $20,000 | $15,000 | $5,000 | Minimal legal, basic bookkeeping |
| Events | $24,000 | $12,000 | $12,000 | Bi-monthly instead of monthly |
| **Fixed Subtotal** | **$356,000** | **$241,000** | **$115,000** | |

### Bear-Case P&L

| Line | Amount |
|------|--------|
| **Revenue** | $468,000 |
| **Variable Expenses** | ($261,000) |
| **Fixed Expenses** | ($241,000) |
| **Total Expenses** | ($502,000) |
| **Net Loss** | **($34,000)** |

### Survival Assessment

| Metric | Value | Assessment |
|--------|-------|------------|
| **Net loss** | ($34,000) | Manageable with $75K starting capital |
| **Cash runway** | ~18-22 months | Survives Year 1 |
| **Staff retained** | 1.33 FTE (from 2.25 plan) | Gallery stays open, founder works harder |
| **Programs running** | Retail + events (bi-monthly) + workshops (fewer) | Core mission intact |
| **Programs cut** | Professional content, dedicated workshop coordination | Can restart when revenue recovers |
| **Artist impact** | Reduced (fewer sales, fewer events, no residencies) | Honest -- but 50/50 model preserved |

### Decision Triggers and Timeline

| Trigger | Threshold | Action | Timeline |
|---------|-----------|--------|----------|
| **Month 3 revenue <$90K cumulative** | 60% of $150K Q1 target | Activate bear-case staffing plan | Immediate |
| **Month 6 revenue <$200K cumulative** | 60% of $335K H1 target | Eliminate content producer position, reduce ED hours | Within 30 days |
| **Month 9 revenue <$320K cumulative** | 60% of $530K 9-mo target | Switch events to bi-monthly, freeze all non-essential spend | Within 30 days |
| **Month 12 revenue <$468K** | Full bear case confirmed | Enter Year 2 in survival mode -- no partner expansion, focus on SF flagship recovery | Year 2 planning |
| **Cash below $15K at any point** | Emergency threshold | Activate emergency protocol (see below) | Immediate |

### Emergency Cash Protocol

If cash balance drops below $15,000:

**Day 1-7:**
1. Freeze all non-essential spending
2. Defer any discretionary vendor payments by 30 days
3. Founder contributes emergency loan (up to $15K if available)
4. Board notified via emergency email

**Day 7-30:**
5. Pursue emergency bridge financing ($10-25K line of credit)
6. Accelerate any pending grant or sponsorship payments
7. Run flash sale event (curated selection, promotional pricing)
8. Increase corporate workshop outreach (highest margin activity)

**Day 30-60:**
9. If cash remains below $15K after 30 days, board convenes emergency meeting
10. Evaluate: reduce gallery hours (4 days/week), sublease portion of space, or negotiate rent reduction with landlord
11. If no path to stability, begin orderly wind-down planning (fulfill artist obligations first)

## Scenario 2: 6-Month Grant Delay

### The Scenario

All grant applications are submitted on time, but no grants are awarded in Year 1. This is plausible -- SFAC and CAC are competitive, and first-time applicants have lower success rates.

### Financial Impact

| | With Grants (Plan) | Without Grants | Delta |
|---|-------------------|----------------|-------|
| **Year 1 Revenue** | $780,000 | $730,000 | -$50,000 |
| **Year 1 Expenses** | $855,000 | $850,000 | -$5,000 (no fiscal sponsor fee) |
| **Year 1 Net** | ($75,000) | ($120,000) | -$45,000 worse |

### Specific Impacts

1. **Workshop subsidies**: Without grant-funded school programs, all workshops must be revenue-positive. Eliminate free/subsidized workshops until grants arrive.
2. **Residencies**: Without grant funding for residencies, must rely entirely on corporate/individual sponsors. If sponsors don't materialize, residencies delayed to Year 2.
3. **Operating cash**: Grant revenue was expected in Month 4 and Month 9. Without it, those months are $25K and $15K worse on cash flow.
4. **Fiscal sponsor relationship**: If no grants flow through the sponsor, the 501(c)(3) structure provides no value. Question whether fiscal sponsorship fee is justified.

### Response Plan

| Timeline | Action |
|----------|--------|
| **Pre-launch** | Apply to 6-8 grants (not just 3-4). Double the application pipeline to increase probability of at least one award. |
| **Month 3 (no SFAC result)** | Do not panic. Grant cycles often run late. Continue normal operations. |
| **Month 6 (confirmed $0 grants)** | Activate: (1) Increase corporate workshop pricing/frequency to compensate, (2) Pursue 2 additional private foundation grants, (3) Reduce content budget by 50%, (4) Approach fiscal sponsor about deferred fees |
| **Month 9 (still $0 grants)** | Evaluate fiscal sponsorship value. If no grants expected in next 6 months, consider operating as pure for-profit LLC (simpler structure, no sponsor fees). Reapply for grants in Year 2 with operational track record. |
| **Month 12** | Year 2 grant applications include 12-month operational data, making applications stronger. Expected grant success rate increases from 50% to 60-70% with demonstrated track record. |

### Key Insight

**Grants are easier to get in Year 2.** First-time applicants without operational data are at a disadvantage. Running for a year -- even without grants -- produces the track record that makes Year 2 applications much stronger. This is an argument for NOT over-relying on Year 1 grants and ensuring the model works without them.

## Scenario 3: Partner Failure Cascade

### The Scenario

Year 2: Rossi onboards its first LA partner gallery in Month 14. By Month 16, the partner closes or publicly violates Rossi brand standards (artist exploitation, quality collapse, or public controversy). This damages the Rossi brand and chills interest from other potential partners.

### Impact Assessment

| Dimension | Impact | Severity |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| **Financial** | Loss of $30-50K in projected partner collaboration revenue Year 2 | Medium |
| **Brand** | Negative press, artist community questions Rossi's judgment | High |
| **Pipeline** | Oakland and Portland prospects hesitate or withdraw | High |
| **Internal** | Artists question expansion strategy, board tension | Medium |
| **Year 2 revenue** | $1.25M projection drops to $900K-$1.0M | Medium-High |

### Response Plan

**Immediate (Week 1):**
1. Invoke exit clause -- formally remove partner from network
2. Issue public statement: "Rossi Network is committed to artist-first values. [Partner] no longer meets our standards." Brief, factual, no drama.
3. Contact all Rossi artists whose work was at the partner location -- ensure all art is returned and artist obligations fulfilled
4. Board emergency meeting to review and document what happened

**Short-Term (Month 1-2):**
5. Conduct post-mortem: What did we miss in vetting? Update partner criteria.
6. Contact remaining partner prospects proactively -- share what happened, what was learned, and what changed in the vetting process
7. Adjust Year 2 projections downward by $150-200K (remove failed partner revenue + delayed expansion)
8. Increase SF flagship focus to compensate

**Medium-Term (Month 3-6):**
9. Publish revised partner playbook with lessons learned
10. If pipeline is chilled, shift Year 2 from "3 partners" to "1 partner (Oakland, close to home)" and delay East Coast to Year 3
11. Use the failure as a case study in grant applications: "We identified and corrected a quality issue early, demonstrating our governance model works"

**Long-Term:**
12. Add "trial period" to partner onboarding (3-month probation before full network status)
13. Require quarterly quality audits for all partners (artist advisory council reviews)
14. Maintain smaller, higher-quality network rather than hitting partner count targets

### Key Insight

**A partner failure in Year 2 is recoverable if handled well.** The risk is not the failure itself -- it's how Rossi responds. A transparent, values-driven response actually strengthens the brand. "We kicked out a partner who didn't meet our standards" is a powerful credibility signal.

## Scenario 4: Top Artist Departure

### The Scenario

Rossi's top 5 revenue-generating artists are recruited by a traditional gallery offering museum connections, higher-profile exhibitions, and art world legitimacy that Rossi can't yet provide. They leave within a 3-month window.

### Impact Assessment

Using Pareto distribution from Condition 1:

| Departing Artists | % of Revenue | Revenue Loss | Annual Impact |
|-------------------|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| Top 5 artists | 45-55% of retail | $135K - $165K | Catastrophic short-term |

**Additional impacts:**
- Loss of "anchor" artists reduces gallery prestige and foot traffic
- Collector relationships may follow artists to new gallery
- Remaining artists question Rossi's value proposition
- Content library loses strongest stories

### Why This Could Happen

1. Top artists outgrow Rossi -- they need museum-level representation Rossi can't provide yet
2. Traditional gallery offers exclusive representation with higher perceived prestige
3. Artist advisor at another gallery actively recruits Rossi's best talent
4. Economic pressure -- artist needs higher prices that Rossi's community-first pricing can't support

### Why This Might NOT Happen

1. 50/50 split is industry-leading -- traditional galleries take 50-60%
2. Non-exclusive contracts mean artists don't have to leave to show elsewhere
3. Career pipeline (content, connections, workshops) provides value beyond sales
4. Artist governance voice creates loyalty beyond economics
5. Mission alignment -- artists who believe in the cause stay even when money says go

### Response Plan

**Immediate (Week 1-2):**
1. Accept the departure gracefully -- non-exclusive contracts mean this is their right
2. Ensure clean transition (final payments, return of unsold work, content rights)
3. Internally assess: Why did they leave? Exit interviews if possible.
4. Board meeting to evaluate impact and response

**Short-Term (Month 1-3):**
5. Promote next-tier artists into more prominent gallery positions
6. Accelerate pipeline -- identify 3-5 emerging artists ready for more exposure
7. Increase content production on remaining artists to fill gap
8. Honest communication with collector base: new artists to discover, evolution is natural

**Revenue Recovery (Month 3-6):**

| Recovery Lever | Expected Impact | Timeline |
|----------------|----------------|----------|
| Promote 5 mid-tier artists to featured status | Replace 30-40% of lost revenue over 6 months | M1-M6 |
| Add 5-10 new emerging artists to roster | 10-15% revenue replacement as they build following | M3-M12 |
| Increase events frequency (showcase new artists) | $5K-$10K additional event revenue | M2-M6 |
| Target collaboration deals with promoted artists | $15K-$25K new collaboration revenue | M4-M8 |
| Increase online sales push (wider artist base) | $5K-$10K additional online | M2-M6 |
| **Total Recovery** | **60-80% of lost revenue within 12 months** | |

**Structural Fix (Ongoing):**
9. Ensure no single artist exceeds 15% of total retail revenue (revenue concentration cap)
10. If any artist approaches 15%, proactively diversify by promoting others
11. Deepen non-economic value (content, connections, governance, community) so artists have reasons to stay beyond money
12. Build relationships with traditional galleries as PARTNERS, not competitors -- Rossi can be the "farm system" that launches artists who then also show at established galleries

### Key Insight

**Non-exclusive contracts are a feature, not a bug.** They mean artists can show at Rossi AND at traditional galleries simultaneously. The response to "artists leaving" is to make non-exclusive the explicit model: "Our best artists show everywhere. They choose to stay at Rossi because of our values and community. Their success elsewhere validates our pipeline."

## Scenario Summary Matrix

| Scenario | Probability | Financial Impact | Survival? | Key Response |
|----------|------------|-----------------|-----------|-------------|
| **60% Revenue** | 20-25% | -$312K revenue, but variable costs scale down. Net loss $34K. | **YES** -- with cost cuts | Reduce staff to 1.33 FTE, cut content/marketing, bi-monthly events |
| **Grant Delay** | 30-40% | -$50K revenue, -$45K worse net | **YES** -- with bridge financing | Double application pipeline, increase corporate workshops, consider dropping fiscal sponsor if no grants by M9 |
| **Partner Failure** | 15-20% (per partner) | -$150-200K Year 2 revenue, brand damage | **YES** -- slow expansion | Transparent exit, post-mortem, smaller/tighter network |
| **Top Artist Departure** | 25-30% | -$135-165K retail, 60-80% recoverable in 12 months | **YES** -- with pipeline activation | Promote mid-tier, accelerate pipeline, cap artist revenue concentration at 15% |

## Organizational Survival Thresholds

### Minimum Viable Operations

The absolute floor for keeping the gallery open and mission alive:

| Category | Minimum Monthly | Annual | Notes |
|----------|----------------|--------|-------|
| Rent | $10,000 | $120,000 | Non-negotiable |
| 1 Staff (Gallery Manager) | $4,500 | $54,000 | Minimum to keep doors open |
| Founder (unpaid or minimal) | $0 - $2,000 | $0 - $24,000 | Founder absorbs |
| Insurance/Legal | $750 | $9,000 | Non-negotiable |
| Utilities/Tech | $600 | $7,200 | Minimum viable |
| **Minimum Monthly Burn** | **$15,850 - $17,850** | **$190,200 - $214,200** | |

### Revenue Required to Cover Minimum Operations

After COGS (30%) and artist payments (50% of net):
- Every $1 of retail revenue yields $0.35 to Rossi after COGS and artist split
- To cover $190K minimum: need **$543K in retail alone** OR blended with other streams

With other streams (workshops, events, online) contributing $100K:
- Need **$257K in retail** to survive at minimum operations level
- That's ~$990/day, 5 days/week -- approximately half the plan's retail projection

### The Bottom Line

**Rossi can survive at roughly 50-60% of projected retail revenue IF it cuts to minimum operations.** The 50/50 split is sustainable because artist payments scale down proportionally with revenue. The risk is entirely on the fixed cost side (rent, minimum staff). As long as total revenue covers ~$215K in fixed costs plus COGS, the organization survives.

**This is actually good news for an underwriter.** The model has a lower survival threshold than most businesses because its largest cost category (artist payments) is 100% variable.

## Appendix: Decision Framework for Founders

### Monthly Revenue Check

At the end of each month, compare actual cumulative revenue to these thresholds:

| Month | Plan Cumulative | Bear-Case (60%) | Emergency (<50%) |
|-------|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| M3 | $150,000 | $90,000 | $75,000 |
| M6 | $335,000 | $200,000 | $167,000 |
| M9 | $530,000 | $318,000 | $265,000 |
| M12 | $780,000 | $468,000 | $390,000 |

**If actual revenue is:**
- **Above Plan**: Proceed as designed. Consider accelerating hires.
- **60-100% of Plan**: Monitor closely. Defer discretionary spending. No new hires until trajectory improves.
- **50-60% of Plan (Bear Case)**: Activate bear-case cost cuts. Board notified. No expansion.
- **Below 50% (Emergency)**: Activate emergency cash protocol. Board emergency meeting. Evaluate viability.
