# Condition 4: Simplified Year 1 Governance

**Purpose**: Replace the over-engineered dual-board model (14-17 decision-makers) with a right-sized governance structure that scales WITH the organization
**Status**: Revised governance model -- replaces architecture Decision 2 for Year 1
**Date**: 2026-02-07

---

## The Problem with the Original Design

The architecture document (Decision 2) proposed:
- **Governing Board**: 5 members (2 nonprofit experts, 2 artists, 1 community rep)
- **Artist Advisory Council**: 9-12 members (majority elected from 80+ artist roster)
- **Total**: 14-17 decision-makers

For an organization with:
- 2.25 FTE staff
- $780K projected revenue (likely $500-600K actual)
- 1 physical location
- 0 partner galleries

**This is a Fortune 500 governance structure on a corner store budget.** The coordination overhead alone could consume 20-30% of leadership time. Most arts nonprofits at this revenue level have a single board of 5-7 members.

## Revised Model: Phased Governance

### Phase 1: Year 1 (Pre-Revenue $1M) -- Single Advisory Board

**Structure: 5-7 Member Advisory Board**

| Seat | Profile | Why This Person |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| **Seat 1: Founder/Director** | Rossi founder(s) | Operational leadership, vision, artist relationships |
| **Seat 2: Artist Representative** | Elected from Rossi roster | Artist voice in governance, cultural fit guardian |
| **Seat 3: Artist Representative** | Elected from Rossi roster | Second artist voice, different medium/style |
| **Seat 4: Nonprofit Expert** | Grant writer, nonprofit consultant, or fiscal sponsor rep | Financial oversight, grant strategy, compliance |
| **Seat 5: Community Representative** | Mission District resident, business owner, or community leader | Community accountability, local knowledge |
| **Seat 6 (Optional): Legal/Finance** | Attorney or CPA with arts experience | Contract review, tax guidance |
| **Seat 7 (Optional): Industry Expert** | Gallery owner, arts administrator, or brand executive | Market knowledge, network access |

**Total: 5-7 members. 2-3 are artists (29-43%). All have operational relevance.**

### Responsibilities

| Domain | Who Decides | How |
|--------|------------|-----|
| **Day-to-day operations** | Founder/Director | Autonomous -- report to board quarterly |
| **Budget approval** | Full board | Annual vote, quarterly review |
| **Artist roster additions** | Founder + 2 artist reps | Consensus of 3 (replaces full council process) |
| **Exhibition curation** | Founder + artist reps | Collaborative, founder has tiebreak |
| **Grant applications** | Founder + nonprofit expert | Collaborative, founder executes |
| **Brand collaborations** | Full board vote | Requires artist rep approval (veto power preserved) |
| **Partner gallery approval** | Full board vote | Requires artist rep approval |
| **Fiscal sponsor coordination** | Founder + nonprofit expert | Operational |
| **Hiring decisions** | Founder, with board notification | Report at next meeting |
| **Contracts >$10K** | Founder + 1 board member | Dual signature authority |
| **Strategic direction** | Full board | Annual planning session + quarterly check-ins |

### Meeting Schedule

| Meeting Type | Frequency | Duration | Attendees |
|-------------|-----------|----------|-----------|
| **Full Board** | Quarterly (4x/year) | 2 hours | All members |
| **Operations Check-in** | Monthly | 30 min (virtual) | Founder + nonprofit expert |
| **Artist Pulse** | Monthly | 30 min (informal) | Founder + artist reps |
| **Annual Planning** | Annually | Half-day | All members + key staff |

**Total governance time commitment**: ~20 hours/year per board member. Manageable for volunteers.

### Artist Voice Preservation

The concern with simplification is losing artist voice. Here's how it's preserved:

1. **2-3 artist seats on board** (29-43% representation) -- they're in the room for every decision
2. **Artist veto on brand collaborations** -- individual artists can still refuse any collaboration, even if board approves
3. **Artist rep consensus for roster additions** -- no artist joins without both artist reps agreeing
4. **Informal artist pulse meetings** -- monthly check-ins capture concerns early
5. **Non-exclusive contracts** -- artists can leave anytime, the ultimate governance mechanism

### Founder Dependency Mitigation (Year 1 Version)

The original plan's concern about founder dependency is valid, but a 5-7 member board already addresses it:

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| Founder leaves suddenly | Board has authority to hire interim director. Nonprofit expert + artist reps can maintain operations for 90 days. |
| Founder makes unilateral decisions | Dual signature requirement on contracts >$10K. Brand collaborations require board vote. |
| Institutional knowledge in founder's head | Quarterly board meetings include operational briefing. Partner playbook and artist onboarding process documented by Month 6. |
| Founder burnout | Monthly check-ins with nonprofit expert serve as informal mentoring/support. Board can authorize hiring ahead of plan if needed. |

### Phase 2: Year 2 ($1M+ Revenue, 2+ Locations) -- Add Artist Advisory Council

**Trigger**: Revenue exceeds $1M AND at least 2 partner galleries are operational.

**Addition**: Artist Advisory Council (7-9 members)

| Change | From Phase 1 | To Phase 2 |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| **Artist roster decisions** | Founder + 2 artist reps | Artist Advisory Council (7-9 members) |
| **Exhibition curation** | Founder + artist reps | Artist Advisory Council recommends, founder approves |
| **Partner gallery vetting** | Full board with artist rep approval | Artist Advisory Council vets cultural fit, board approves financial/legal |
| **Brand collaboration** | Full board with artist veto | Artist Advisory Council reviews first, board final approval, individual veto preserved |
| **Workshop/residency design** | Founder + staff | Artist Advisory Council designs, staff executes |

**Advisory Board evolves to Governing Board**: The 5-7 member board retains fiduciary oversight but cedes artistic decisions to the council.

**Artist Advisory Council Composition**:
- 5-6 elected from Rossi roster (2-year terms, staggered)
- 1-2 from partner gallery rosters (as network grows)
- 1 external artist (outside perspective)

**Meeting schedule**: Monthly, 1 hour. Can be virtual for partner gallery representatives.

---

### Phase 3: Year 3+ ($2M+ Revenue, 5+ Locations) -- Full Dual-Board

**Trigger**: Revenue exceeds $2M AND 5+ partner galleries are operational.

This is the original architecture Decision 2 from Rex, implemented at the scale where it makes sense:

- **Governing Board**: 5 members (fiduciary, legal, financial oversight)
- **Artist Advisory Council**: 9-12 members (artistic, cultural, programmatic decisions)
- **Executive Director**: Hired professional (not founder) leading operations

At $2M revenue with 6+ FTE staff and 5+ locations, this governance complexity is justified and necessary.

## Why This Is Better

| Dimension | Original (Dual-Board Year 1) | Revised (Phased) |
|-----------|------------------------------|-------------------|
| **Decision speed** | Slow (2 bodies to consult) | Fast (1 board, clear authority) |
| **Coordination overhead** | High (14-17 people) | Low (5-7 people) |
| **Volunteer burden** | Heavy (monthly council + quarterly board) | Light (~20 hrs/year) |
| **Artist voice** | Strong (but bureaucratic) | Strong (direct seats + veto power) |
| **Founder dependency risk** | Mitigated (distributed) | Mitigated (board + documentation) |
| **Scalability** | Over-built for Year 1 | Right-sized, scales with growth |
| **Recruitment difficulty** | Hard (need 14-17 qualified people) | Manageable (need 5-7) |
| **Cost** | Higher (D&O insurance for 2 bodies, meeting costs) | Lower |

**Net effect**: Same governance outcomes (artist voice, founder mitigation, fiduciary oversight) at 1/3 the complexity and cost.
