# Condition 3: Pipeline Validation Evidence

**Purpose**: Demonstrate that the artist career pipeline (workshops -> residencies -> content -> career launch) works with real evidence, not just the "Maria" hypothetical
**Status**: Evidence collection framework + modeled case studies -- **MUST BE POPULATED WITH REAL ARTIST DATA**
**Date**: 2026-02-07

---

## The Pipeline Thesis

The business plan's central claim:

> "Signature style + personal champion + documentation = career launch"

Derived from Chito (streets -> Supreme -> Givenchy) and Barry McGee (SF tagging -> Venice Biennale).

**What the underwriter needs to see**: Evidence that Rossi has already produced some version of this outcome for real artists, even informally, BEFORE formalizing the pipeline.

## 1. Artist Case Studies (Minimum 3 Required)

### Framework: What Each Case Study Must Show

| Element | Evidence Required | Why It Matters |
|---------|------------------|----------------|
| **Before Rossi** | Where was the artist before joining? Income? Visibility? | Establishes baseline |
| **Rossi Intervention** | What did Rossi provide? (Space, sales, connections, exposure) | Shows the mechanism |
| **Outcome** | What changed? (Income, opportunities, recognition) | Proves the model |
| **Timeline** | How long from joining to outcome? | Sets realistic expectations |
| **Attribution** | Would this have happened without Rossi? | Honest assessment |

### Ideal Case Study Profiles

To maximize underwriter confidence, the 3-5 case studies should represent different tiers:

| Case Study | Profile | What It Proves |
|-----------|---------|---------------|
| **#1: Top Performer** | Artist earning $10K+/year through Rossi, landed brand deals or external gallery shows | The pipeline can produce real career outcomes |
| **#2: Mid-Tier Riser** | Artist who joined with nothing, now earning $3-5K/year with growing trajectory | The pipeline works for emerging artists, not just established ones |
| **#3: Community Impact** | Artist from Mission District, first gallery representation, positive community impact | The mission is real -- community-embedded, not gentrification |
| **#4 (Bonus): Workshop Graduate** | Someone who came through a workshop or event and is now on the roster | Validates the discovery funnel (even informally) |
| **#5 (Bonus): Content Success** | Artist whose Rossi documentation led directly to an opportunity | Validates content-as-discovery thesis |

---

## 2. Workshop Conversion Evidence

### Current State

| Metric | [ACTUAL] | Modeled Estimate |
|--------|----------|-----------------|
| **Workshops conducted (ever)** | [ACTUAL] | 0-5 (informal) |
| **Total workshop participants** | [ACTUAL] | 0-75 |
| **Participants who later joined roster** | [ACTUAL] | 0-3 |
| **Conversion rate** | [ACTUAL] | Unknown |

**If Rossi has NOT conducted formal workshops yet**, document:
- Informal teaching/mentoring that has occurred
- Artists who were discovered through events (proxy for workshop discovery)
- Plans for pilot workshop with specific dates, curriculum, instructor

### Workshop Pilot Plan (If No Historical Data)

| Element | Plan |
|---------|------|
| **Pilot Workshop Date** | [TARGET: Within 60 days of funding] |
| **Format** | 4-hour introduction to graffiti art techniques |
| **Instructor** | [NAME -- Rossi roster artist with teaching experience] |
| **Capacity** | 12-15 participants |
| **Pricing** | $75 (community rate) / $125 (standard) |
| **Location** | 791 Valencia (gallery space, off-hours or closed day) |
| **Measurement** | Track all participants for 6 months: did any develop signature style? Express interest in roster? Return for more? |
| **Success Criteria** | 8+ participants, 2+ express interest in further engagement, 1+ explores roster path |

**Underwriter Note**: A single successful pilot workshop with documented outcomes is worth more than 100 pages of projections. Recommend running pilot BEFORE submitting final funding application.

## 3. Event Engagement Evidence

### Historical Event Data

| Event | Date | Attendance | Sales During Event | New Contacts Made | Artists Featured |
|-------|------|------------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| [ACTUAL] | [ACTUAL] | [ACTUAL] | [ACTUAL] | [ACTUAL] | [ACTUAL] |
| [ACTUAL] | [ACTUAL] | [ACTUAL] | [ACTUAL] | [ACTUAL] | [ACTUAL] |
| [ACTUAL] | [ACTUAL] | [ACTUAL] | [ACTUAL] | [ACTUAL] | [ACTUAL] |
| [ACTUAL] | [ACTUAL] | [ACTUAL] | [ACTUAL] | [ACTUAL] | [ACTUAL] |
| [ACTUAL] | [ACTUAL] | [ACTUAL] | [ACTUAL] | [ACTUAL] | [ACTUAL] |
| [ACTUAL] | [ACTUAL] | [ACTUAL] | [ACTUAL] | [ACTUAL] | [ACTUAL] |

### Event-to-Pipeline Connections

Document any instances where an event led to:
- [ ] A new artist discovering Rossi and later joining the roster
- [ ] A collector becoming a repeat buyer
- [ ] A brand representative making contact for future collaboration
- [ ] Press coverage that led to new opportunities
- [ ] Community member expressing interest in workshops

Each documented instance validates the "events as discovery mechanism" thesis.

---

## 4. Collector Community Evidence

### Existing Collector Base

| Metric | [ACTUAL] |
|--------|----------|
| **Total unique buyers (trailing 12 months)** | [ACTUAL] |
| **Repeat buyers (2+ purchases)** | [ACTUAL] |
| **Average collector lifetime value** | [ACTUAL] |
| **Highest single collector spend** | [ACTUAL] |
| **Email list subscribers** | [ACTUAL] |
| **Event attendees (email-captured)** | [ACTUAL] |

### Collector Testimonials (2-3 Recommended)

> "[ACTUAL quote from collector about why they buy from Rossi]" -- [Collector name, optional]

> "[ACTUAL quote about the 50/50 model, artist relationships, or community]" -- [Collector name, optional]

---

## 5. Partner Interest Evidence

### Letters of Intent / Expressions of Interest

For Year 2 partner expansion, document any existing relationships:

| Potential Partner | Location | Contact | Relationship | Interest Level |
|------------------|----------|---------|-------------|---------------|
| [ACTUAL] | Los Angeles | [ACTUAL] | [ACTUAL -- how do you know them?] | [ACTUAL -- expressed interest? Informal conversation?] |
| [ACTUAL] | Oakland | [ACTUAL] | [ACTUAL] | [ACTUAL] |
| [ACTUAL] | Portland | [ACTUAL] | [ACTUAL] | [ACTUAL] |

**Ideal Evidence**: A signed letter of intent from at least 1 gallery in LA or Oakland stating interest in joining the Rossi network, conditional on Rossi establishing the partner program.

**Minimum Evidence**: Documented conversations (emails, meeting notes) with 3-5 galleries in target markets expressing interest in the model.

---

## 6. Content Impact Evidence

### Existing Content Performance

| Content Piece | Platform | Views/Reach | Engagement | Outcome |
|--------------|----------|-------------|------------|---------|
| [ACTUAL -- artist feature, event post, etc.] | [Instagram/YouTube/etc.] | [ACTUAL] | [ACTUAL] | [Any measurable outcome?] |
| [ACTUAL] | [ACTUAL] | [ACTUAL] | [ACTUAL] | [ACTUAL] |
| [ACTUAL] | [ACTUAL] | [ACTUAL] | [ACTUAL] | [ACTUAL] |

### Content-to-Opportunity Connections

Document any instance where content led directly to:
- [ ] An artist receiving an external opportunity (exhibition, commission, press)
- [ ] A collector discovering Rossi and making a purchase
- [ ] A brand reaching out for collaboration
- [ ] Increased foot traffic to the gallery

Each documented instance validates the GX1000 "content = discovery engine" thesis.

## 7. Validation Scorecard

### Pipeline Element Validation Status

| Pipeline Element | Evidence Status | Confidence | Action Required |
|-----------------|----------------|------------|-----------------|
| **Workshops discover talent** | [RED/YELLOW/GREEN] | [%] | [What's needed] |
| **Residencies provide champions** | [RED/YELLOW/GREEN] | [%] | [What's needed] |
| **Content creates visibility** | [RED/YELLOW/GREEN] | [%] | [What's needed] |
| **Events drive community** | [RED/YELLOW/GREEN] | [%] | [What's needed] |
| **50/50 split retains artists** | [RED/YELLOW/GREEN] | [%] | [What's needed] |
| **Collectors exist and buy** | [RED/YELLOW/GREEN] | [%] | [What's needed] |
| **Partners are interested** | [RED/YELLOW/GREEN] | [%] | [What's needed] |

### Scoring Guide

- **GREEN**: Real data from multiple instances, pattern is clear
- **YELLOW**: Some evidence exists (1-2 instances), pattern is plausible but unproven at scale
- **RED**: No evidence yet, purely projected

**Underwriter Threshold**: Minimum 4 of 7 elements at YELLOW or GREEN for funding consideration. Any element at RED requires documented plan to validate within 90 days of funding.

## 8. Honest Gaps Acknowledgment

### What We Can Prove Today
- [List what Rossi CAN demonstrate with real data]

### What We Believe But Can't Yet Prove
- [List assumptions that are logical but unvalidated]

### What We'll Validate in Year 1
- [List specific validation milestones with dates]

| Validation Milestone | Target Date | Method | Success Criteria |
|---------------------|-------------|--------|-----------------|
| First pilot workshop | Month 2-3 | Run workshop, track participants | 8+ attendees, 2+ further engagement |
| First residency outcome | Month 8-9 | Document residency, track artist 6 months | Artist gains 1+ external opportunity |
| Content impact measurement | Month 6 | Track content -> gallery visit -> purchase funnel | Attributable revenue from content |
| Collector retention rate | Month 12 | Analyze repeat purchase data | 20%+ repeat rate |
| Partner pilot | Month 14-15 | First partner gallery operational | Partner maintains quality standards |

**Underwriter Note**: Intellectual honesty about gaps is more persuasive than pretending gaps don't exist. Funders fund teams that know what they don't know and have plans to learn.
