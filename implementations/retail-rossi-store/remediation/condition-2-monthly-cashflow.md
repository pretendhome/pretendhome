## 1. Monthly Revenue Model (Months 1-18)

### Retail Revenue (Gallery + Online)

Base monthly retail: $29,167 ($350K / 12), with seasonal adjustments and 2% monthly growth from expanded content/marketing.

| Month | Base | Seasonal Adj | Growth Factor | **Retail Revenue** |
|-------|------|-------------|---------------|-------------------|
| M1 (Mar 2026) | $29,167 | -10% | 1.00 | **$26,250** |

| M10 (Dec 2026) | $29,167 | +40% | 1.18 | **$48,180** |
| M11 (Jan 2027) | $29,167 | -20% | 1.20 | **$28,000** |
| M12 (Feb 2027) | $29,167 | -20% | 1.22 | **$28,488** |
| M13 (Mar 2027) | $29,167 | -10% | 1.24 | **$32,554** |

| M18 (Aug 2027) | $29,167 | -15% | 1.34 | **$33,554** |

**Year 1 Retail Total (M1-M12): $390,635**
**Note**: This is below the $500K business plan projection. This model uses a $350K baseline with modest growth. If actual baseline is higher, adjust upward.

### Workshop Revenue

| Month | Public Workshops | Corporate | Revenue |
|-------|-----------------|-----------|---------|
| M1-M2 | 0 (setup) | 0 | **$0** |
| M3 | 1 @ $1,500 (half capacity) | 0 | **$1,500** |
| M4 | 1 @ $2,500 | 0 | **$2,500** |
| M5 | 1 @ $3,000 | 0 | **$3,000** |
| M6 | 1 @ $3,500 | 1 @ $3,000 | **$6,500** |
| M7 | 1 @ $3,500 | 0 | **$3,500** |
| M8 | 1 @ $3,500 | 0 | **$3,500** |
| M9 | 1 @ $4,000 | 1 @ $3,500 | **$7,500** |
| M10 | 1 @ $4,000 | 0 | **$4,000** |
| M11 | 1 @ $4,000 | 0 | **$4,000** |
| M12 | 1 @ $4,000 | 1 @ $4,000 | **$8,000** |
| M13 | 1 @ $4,500 | 0 | **$4,500** |
| M14 | 1 @ $4,500 | 1 @ $4,000 | **$8,500** |
| M15 | 1 @ $4,500 | 0 | **$4,500** |
| M16 | 1 @ $5,000 | 1 @ $4,500 | **$9,500** |
| M17 | 1 @ $5,000 | 0 | **$5,000** |
| M18 | 1 @ $5,000 | 1 @ $5,000 | **$10,000** |

**Year 1 Workshop Total (M1-M12): $44,000**
**Note**: Below $80K plan projection. Ramp-up is slower than assumed. Corporate workshops start at $3K, not $5K, and build credibility over time.

### Grant Revenue

| Month | Grant | Amount | Notes |
|-------|-------|--------|-------|
| M1 | None | $0 | Applications submitted |
| M2 | None | $0 | |
| M3 | None | $0 | SFAC deadline was Oct/Nov -- results pending |
| M4 | **SFAC Individual Artist Commission** | **$25,000** | If awarded (50% probability) |
| M5 | None | $0 | |
| M6 | None | $0 | CAC applications submitted |
| M7 | None | $0 | |
| M8 | None | $0 | |
| M9 | **CAC Arts & Cultural Organizations** | **$15,000** | If awarded (50% probability) |
| M10 | None | $0 | |
| M11 | None | $0 | |
| M12 | **Private Foundation** | **$10,000** | If awarded (30% probability) |
| M13-M18 | Repeat cycle | Various | |

**Year 1 Grant Total (Expected Value): $30,000**
**Note**: Below $50K projection. Using expected value (amount x probability) instead of assuming all grants are awarded. Actual could be $0 (all rejected) or $50K+ (all awarded plus additional).

**CRITICAL**: Grants arrive as lump sums on unpredictable schedules. The cash flow model must survive months with $0 grant revenue.

### Event Revenue

| Month | Event Type | Revenue |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| M1 | Opening exhibition | **$2,500** |
| M2 | Group show | **$2,000** |
| M3 | Live painting night | **$3,000** |
| M4 | Exhibition + workshop showcase | **$3,500** |
| M5 | Group show | **$2,500** |
| M6 | Residency launch event | **$4,000** |
| M7 | Summer group show | **$2,000** |
| M8 | Music/art crossover | **$3,500** |
| M9 | Fall exhibition | **$4,500** |
| M10 | Art walk / open studios | **$5,000** |
| M11 | Pre-holiday group show | **$5,500** |
| M12 | Holiday exhibition + market | **$7,000** |
| M13-M18 | Continued monthly events | ~$3,500-$6,000/mo |

**Year 1 Event Total (M1-M12): $45,000**
**Note**: Below $60K projection. Events include ticket revenue, additional sales during events, and small sponsorships. Does not include bar revenue (requires liquor license or catering partner).

### Collaboration & Residency Revenue

| Month | Source | Revenue | Notes |
|-------|--------|---------|-------|
| M1-M5 | None | $0 | Pipeline building |
| M6 | First residency sponsorship | **$5,000** | Individual sponsor, 1-month residency |
| M7 | None | $0 | |
| M8 | Small brand collaboration | **$15,000** | Local SF business, mural project |
| M9 | Second residency sponsorship | **$5,000** | |
| M10 | None | $0 | |
| M11 | Brand collaboration #2 | **$20,000** | Streetwear brand, limited edition |
| M12 | Third residency sponsorship | **$10,000** | Named residency, corporate sponsor |
| M13-M18 | Growing pipeline | Various | |

**Year 1 Collaboration + Residency Total: $55,000**
**Note**: Roughly aligned with plan ($40K collab + $30K residency = $70K). Timing is back-loaded because pipeline takes 6+ months to build.

### Online/Digital Revenue

Steady at ~$1,500-$2,500/month, growing to $2,500-$3,500 by M18.

**Year 1 Online Total: $20,000** (Aligned with plan)

## 4. Cash Flow Analysis

### Key Findings

| Metric | Value | Assessment |
|--------|-------|------------|
| **Starting Cash** | $75,000 ($25K founder + $50K impact investment) | Minimum viable |
| **Lowest Cash Point (Year 1)** | $38,749 (Month 11) | Adequate but thin |
| **Year 1 Ending Cash** | $41,320 | Positive but no reserve |
| **Lowest Cash Point (M13-18)** | $10,480 (Month 17) | **DANGER ZONE** |
| **Month 18 Ending Cash** | $12,624 | Inadequate reserve |
| **Year 1 Total Revenue** | ~$585,000 | **Below $780K plan projection** |
| **Year 1 Net Loss** | ~($33,680) | Better than plan's -$75K due to lower staffing in H1 |
| **Months of negative cash flow** | 12 of 18 | Typical for startup, but stressful |

### Critical Cash Danger Points

1. **Month 17 ($10,480)**: If ANY grant is delayed or revenue dips, cash goes negative. This is the highest-risk month in the entire 18-month window.
2. **Month 13 ($21,414)**: Year 2 staffing increases hit before Year 2 revenue ramps. The transition from Year 1 to Year 2 is the most dangerous period.
3. **Any month without grant revenue**: Fixed costs alone require ~$23K-$35K/month. Without grant lump sums, cash depletes at $5K-$12K/month.

### Minimum Cash Threshold

**Recommended minimum: $20,000** (approximately 1 month of fixed costs + minimum artist payments). This provides a 30-day emergency runway.

**Action triggers when cash drops below $20K:**
1. Freeze all non-essential spending (marketing, content equipment, travel)
2. Delay new hires by 90 days
3. Accelerate grant application cycle
4. Pursue emergency bridge financing (line of credit, founder loan)
5. Increase corporate workshop outreach (highest-margin activity)

---

## 5. Grant Delay Scenario

### What If No Grants Arrive in Year 1?

| Month | Cash (With Grants) | Cash (No Grants) | Delta |
|-------|-------------------|------------------|-------|
| M4 | $68,887 | $43,887 | -$25,000 |
| M9 | $47,786 | $7,786 | -$40,000 |
| M12 | $41,320 | ($8,680) | -$50,000 |

**Without grants, cash goes negative in Month 11-12.**

**Required response if no grants by Month 6:**
1. Secure $25K emergency bridge (line of credit or founder loan)
2. Delay content producer hire from M7 to M10
3. Reduce event frequency from monthly to bi-monthly
4. Intensify corporate workshop sales (target 2 per quarter instead of 1)
5. Explore fiscal sponsorship alternatives if sponsor is blocking grant applications

---

## 6. Revenue Sensitivity by Month

### Which Revenue Streams Matter Most, When?

| Period | Critical Stream | Why |
|--------|----------------|-----|
| **M1-M3** | Retail | Only significant revenue source. Events are supplemental. |
| **M4-M6** | Grants + Retail | First grant arrival makes or breaks cash position |
| **M7-M9** | Collaborations | First brand deal provides critical non-retail revenue |
| **M10-M12** | Retail (holiday) + Collaborations | Holiday season carries Q4. Second collaboration deal critical. |
| **M13-M15** | Grants (Year 2 cycle) + Workshops | Year 2 grants must arrive. Workshop revenue now meaningful. |
| **M16-M18** | Partner revenue + Collaborations | Partner network must start contributing or Year 2 projections fail |

---

## 7. Implications for Funding Request

### Current Request: $150K

| Source | Amount | Timing | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Impact Investment | $50,000 | Month 1 | Must be secured pre-launch |
| SFAC Grant | $50,000 | Month 4 (expected) | **50% probability** |
| CAC Grant | $25,000 | Month 9 (expected) | **50% probability** |
| Private Foundation | $25,000 | Month 12 (expected) | **30% probability** |

### Expected Value of Funding: $100,000 - $110,000

Not $150K. At 50% grant success rate, actual funding is likely $100-110K.

### Recommended Funding Structure

| Source | Amount | Timing | Certainty |
|--------|--------|--------|-----------|
| Impact Investment / CDFI Loan | $50,000 | Month 1 | High (secured pre-launch) |
| Founder Capital | $25,000 | Month 1 | High (founder commitment) |

| Emergency Line of Credit | $25,000 (available) | As needed | Contingency only |
