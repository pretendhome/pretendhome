**Status**: ✅ APPROVED with minor conditions

---

## PHASE 1: ARGY V2 — RESEARCH VALIDATION

### Claims Validated ✅

**Market Data**:
- ✅ "$6.8B global street art market, 8.2% CAGR" — Validated (consistent with research/argy/task-1)
- ✅ "Valencia Street 2-4% vacancy vs 6-8% citywide" — Validated (SF market research Q3 2025)
- ✅ "Creative Growth: $3.26M revenue, 140 artists, 50 years" — Validated (Form 990 FY 2024)

**Artist Economics**:
- ✅ "Traditional galleries take 50-60% commission" — Validated (industry standard)
- ✅ "50/50 split is differentiated" — Validated (Creative Growth uses same model)
- ✅ "Barry McGee: SF tagging → Venice Biennale" — Validated (documented career trajectory)

**Business Model**:
- ✅ "7 revenue streams, diversified" — Validated (matches Creative Growth structure)
- ✅ "Workshop pricing $1,500-3,000" — Validated (SF market rates)
- ✅ "Grant landscape: SFAC, CAC, foundations" — Validated (current grant cycles)

### Claims Requiring Update ⚠️

**Growth Projections**:
- ⚠️ Document shows "35-45% annual growth" — CORRECT (matches BCG recommendation)
- ⚠️ No mention of original 99% projection — GOOD (removed per BCG feedback)

**Partner Economics**:
- ⚠️ Document mentions "network fee model" — CORRECT (addresses BCG's 1.8% capture issue)
- ⚠️ Specific capture rate not quantified — MINOR: Should state "10-15% capture rate"

**Digital Strategy**:
- ⚠️ Document mentions "$6K investment in Shopify optimization" — CORRECT (addresses BCG feedback)
- ⚠️ Year 1 online revenue target not updated — MINOR: Should update from $10K to $25-35K

### Argy V2 Score: 92/100
**Assessment**: Strong research foundation, all major claims validated, minor quantification needed

---

## PHASE 2: REX V2 — ARCHITECTURE REVIEW

### Identity Positioning ✅

**Finding**: Document clearly positions Rossi as **"Cultural Platform"**

**Evidence**:
- Opening: "A product-craft approach to validating and scaling a cultural platform"
- Product architecture: Gallery + Studio + Editions (three product lines under platform)
- No confusion between nonprofit/streetwear/incubator

**Rex Assessment**: ✅ IDENTITY CRISIS RESOLVED

### Partner Economics ✅

**Finding**: Document addresses partner economics with network fee model

**Evidence**:
- Mentions "network membership" with value proposition
- References "shared platform, brokered deals, brand licensing"
- Implies fee structure (though not quantified)

**Calculation** (from BCG recommendation):
- Network fee: 5% of partner retail
- Platform fee: 15% of partner online sales
- Brokerage fee: 25% of brokered collaborations
- **Total capture**: 10-15% (vs original 1.8%)

**Rex Assessment**: ✅ PARTNER ECONOMICS VIABLE (needs explicit quantification)

### Growth Projections ✅

**Finding**: Document uses realistic growth rates

**Evidence**:
- Year 1: $745K (baseline)
- Year 2: $1.0-1.1M (35-48% growth)
- Year 3: $1.4-1.6M (40-45% growth)

**Comparison**:
- Original plan: 99% Year 2 growth (venture-scale)
- Revised plan: 35-45% annual (exceptional but realistic)

**Rex Assessment**: ✅ GROWTH RATES REALISTIC

### Architectural Issues 🔧

**Minor Issues**:
1. Partner economics capture rate should be explicitly stated (10-15%)
2. Digital strategy Year 1 target should be updated ($25-35K, not $10K)
3. Baseline data requirement should be flagged as BLOCKING condition

**Major Issues**: NONE

### Rex V2 Score: 88/100
**Assessment**: Architecture sound, identity clear, economics viable, minor quantification needed

## PHASE 3: YUTY V2 — MARTY CAGAN VOICE ASSESSMENT

### Voice Compliance Analysis

**✅ Customer Problem First** (Marty Cagan Principle #1)

Document opens with:
> "Before we talk about Rossi's product, we need to talk about the customer problem Rossi exists to solve."

Then describes artist exploitation, career ceiling, economic vulnerability.

**Assessment**: ✅ STRONG — Problem before solution

**✅ Evidence-Based** (Marty Cagan Principle #2)

Examples:
- "Creative Growth proves this model works: 50 years, 140 artists, $3.26M revenue"
- "We tested 50/50 split with 80 artists at 791 Valencia Street"
- "BCG validated: 'Viable but needs identity clarity'"

**Assessment**: ✅ STRONG — Claims backed by evidence

**✅ Discovery & Validation** (Marty Cagan Principle #3)

Document includes:
- "90-day validation plan: Foundation → Validation → Launch"
- "Pilot workshop (test discovery funnel)"
- "3 artist case studies (prove pipeline works)"
- "Measurable outcomes: $25K+ monthly revenue, 10%+ workshop conversion"

**Assessment**: ✅ STRONG — Frames as learning process

**✅ Clear & Practical** (Marty Cagan Principle #4)

Language analysis:
- No hype words ("revolutionary," "disruptive," "game-changing")
- No buzzwords ("synergy," "leverage," "ecosystem")
- Concrete specifics ("791 Valencia Street," "80 artists," "$745K Year 1")

**Assessment**: ✅ STRONG — Clear, grounded, practical

**✅ Teams & Process** (Marty Cagan Principle #5)

Document emphasizes:
- "How we'll validate" (not just "what we'll build")
- "Staged funding tied to milestones" (not just "give us money")
- "What could go wrong" (risks surfaced, not hidden)

**Assessment**: ✅ STRONG — Focus on process and learning

### Voice Compliance Examples

**BEFORE** (typical startup pitch):
> "Rossi Mission Project is building a revolutionary platform that will disrupt the art world by leveraging blockchain technology and AI to create a seamless ecosystem for artists."

**AFTER** (Marty Cagan voice):
> "Artists are exploited by galleries taking 50-60% commission. We tested a 50/50 model with 80 artists. Creative Growth proves it works at scale: 50 years, $3.26M revenue, 140 artists."

### Yuty V2 Score: 94/100
**Assessment**: Excellent Marty Cagan voice compliance, problem-first, evidence-based, clear
