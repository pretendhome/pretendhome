# ROSSI MISSION PROJECT
## Vision Deck: Building the Artist-First Cultural Platform

**Prepared for**: Investors, Partners, and Stakeholders  
**Date**: February 7, 2026  
**Status**: Investment-Ready with Staged Funding Model

---

## THE VISION IN ONE SENTENCE

**Rossi Mission Project is building the cultural platform where graffiti meets gallery — artist-owned, community-rooted, deliberately scarce — proving that artist empowerment and commercial success are not opposites, but partners.**

---

## THE PROBLEM WE'RE SOLVING

### Artists Are Exploited by the Traditional Gallery System

**Traditional galleries take 50-60% commission while providing minimal career support.**

The result:
- Talented graffiti artists remain economically vulnerable
- No structured pathway from street art to sustainable career
- Galleries extract value from street culture without reinvesting in the community

**The Mission District has produced world-class artists** (Barry McGee, Chito, the Mission School movement) **but the economic model hasn't evolved to support the next generation.**

---

## OUR SOLUTION: THE ARTIST-FIRST MODEL

### Three Pillars That Work Together

```
DISCOVER                    DEVELOP                     LAUNCH
   ↓                           ↓                           ↓
Community Events    →    Art Workshops      →    Charitable Residencies
(exhibitions, live      (skill-building,        (stipend, mentorship,
painting, music)        signature style)         documentation)
   ↓                           ↓                           ↓
Find emerging talent    Teach signature style    Provide personal champion
Build community         Build skills             Create documentation
Validate artists        Validate market          Launch careers
```

**The Formula**: Signature Style + Personal Champion + Documentation = Career Launch

**The Proof**: This is how Chito became a Givenchy designer. This is how Barry McGee went from SF tagging to the Venice Biennale. We're systematizing what the Mission District has done organically for 40 years.

## WHAT MAKES US DIFFERENT

### 1. Artist Economics: 50/50 Split

**Artists keep 50% of net revenue** (after cost of goods sold)

**Industry standard**: Galleries take 50-60%, artists get 40-50%  
**Rossi model**: Artists get 50%, Rossi gets 50%

**Why this matters**: In the creator economy era, "artists keep 50%" is a brand message as powerful as Patagonia's "1% for the Planet." It's not charity — it's recognition that artists create 100% of the value.

### 2. Cultural Credibility: 791 Valencia Street

**Location is brand.** The Mission District has 40+ years of graffiti-to-museum DNA. This address carries cultural credibility that money cannot buy.

**80+ artists on our roster** = a content engine that most fashion brands pay millions to access. Our roster IS our brand. The gallery is just the showroom.

### 3. Scarcity Economics: 250 SKU Cap

**We expand through breadth (more locations), not depth (more inventory).**

Supreme proved that scarcity protects value. We apply this to emerging artists:
- 250 SKU cap per location
- 3-5 brand collaborations per year (not unlimited)
- Expansion through new cities, not more products

**This protects artist value and brand integrity.**

### 4. Proven Model: Creative Growth Validates It Works

**Creative Growth Art Center (Oakland)** has operated our exact model for 50 years:
- Nonprofit gallery, 50/50 artist split
- 140 artists, $1.06M annual art sales
- $3.26M total revenue (34% grants, 33% art sales, 32% programs)
- SFMOMA partnership, international recognition

**We're not inventing something new. We're adapting a proven model to graffiti/street art.**

---

## THE MARKET OPPORTUNITY

### $6.8 Billion Global Street Art Market

- Growing at 8.2% CAGR through 2030
- Driven by legitimization in traditional galleries
- Rising demand from millennial collectors
- Digital documentation allows murals to "travel globally within hours"

### San Francisco: Healthy Retail Corridor

- **Valencia Street vacancy**: 2-4% (vs 6-8% citywide)
- **791 Valencia**: Prime Mission District location
- **Collector base**: Established and growing

### Geographic Expansion Opportunity

**Target cities** (all with established street art scenes):
- Oakland (Year 2) — BART accessible, Creative Growth adjacency
- LA Arts District (Year 2) — Largest West Coast market
- NYC Lower East Side (Year 3) — National presence
- Seattle, Portland (Year 3) — Pacific Northwest network

## THE BUSINESS MODEL

### 7 Revenue Streams (Diversified for Sustainability)

| Stream | Year 1 | % | Strategy |
|--------|--------|---|----------|
| **Retail Sales** | $350K | 45% | Gallery + online, 250 SKU cap |
| **Grants** | $200K | 26% | SFAC, CAC, private foundations |
| **Workshops** | $100K | 13% | Public ($50-150) + corporate ($1,500-3,000) |
| **Events** | $60K | 8% | Monthly exhibitions, quarterly majors |
| **Collaborations** | $40K | 5% | 2-3 brand partnerships, artist-approved |
| **Residencies** | $20K | 3% | Sponsored residencies, $5K-25K each |
| **Online** | $10K | 1% | E-commerce, growing to $45K-80K Year 2-3 |
| **TOTAL** | **$780K** | **100%** | **No single stream >45%** |

**Why diversification matters**: Creative Growth proves that grant-stabilized models survive retail fluctuations. Single-stream models are vulnerable.

### Artist-First Economics

**Total artist payments**: $211K (27% of total revenue)
- Retail: 50% of net revenue
- Workshops: 60% to teaching artists
- Collaborations: 70% to featured artists

**This is not a cost — it's the brand.** Artist empowerment IS the product.

## GROWTH TRAJECTORY (Revised for Realism)

### Disciplined Growth, Not Venture-Scale

| Metric | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Revenue** | $745K | $1.0-1.1M | $1.4-1.6M |
| **Growth Rate** | Baseline | 35-45% | 35-45% |
| **Locations** | 1 (SF) | 2 (SF + Oakland) | 3-4 (+ LA + 1 other) |
| **Artists** | 80 | 120-140 | 180-220 |
| **New Cities** | 0 | 1 | 1-2 |

**35-45% annual growth is exceptional** — it puts Rossi at $1.4-1.6M by Year 3, roughly half of Creative Growth's revenue, achieved in 3 years vs their 50 years.

**This is a compelling story without requiring everything to go perfectly.**

## WHY NOW?

### Market Timing

1. **Street art is legitimizing** — $6.8B market, 8.2% CAGR, museums acquiring graffiti artists
2. **Creator economy is booming** — Artists expect fair economics, not exploitation
3. **Scarcity is valued** — Supreme, Stüssy, ALIFE proved limited drops work
4. **Mission District is gentrifying** — Cultural credibility is valuable before it's priced out

### Operational Readiness

1. **791 Valencia Street** — Prime location secured
2. **80+ artists** — Roster established
3. **Creative Growth model** — Proven for 50 years
4. **Three expert validations** — Business Manager, Underwriter, Product Manager all say "GO with conditions"

### Risk Mitigation

1. **Staged funding** — $75K → $60K → $50K tied to milestones
2. **Diversified revenue** — 7 streams, no single >45%
3. **Variable costs** — Artist payments scale with revenue (downside protection)
4. **Proven model** — Creative Growth validates it works

**The risk is not "will this work?" — Creative Growth proves it works.**

**The risk is "can Rossi execute?" — and that's what the 90-day plan validates.**

## THE VISION: 3 YEARS FROM NOW

### Rossi Mission Project in 2029

**3-4 locations** across SF, Oakland, LA, and one other city

**180-220 artists** in the network, with documented career trajectories

**$1.4-1.6M annual revenue**, diversified across 7 streams

**20-30 artists launched** into sustainable careers (documented case studies)

**National brand recognition** as the artist-first cultural platform

**Proof of concept** for a new model: artist empowerment + commercial success

---

## THE BIGGER PICTURE

### What We're Really Building

**Rossi is not just a gallery. It's a proof of concept.**

**The question we're answering**: Can you build a commercially successful cultural platform that puts artists first?

**The traditional answer**: No. Artist empowerment and commercial success are opposites. Choose one.

**Our answer**: They're not opposites. They're partners.

- **50/50 split** proves artists can earn fairly AND the business can sustain itself
- **Scarcity economics** proves you can grow through breadth (more locations) without diluting value
- **Integrated pipeline** proves you can systematize artist development, not just discover talent randomly
- **Creative Growth** proves this model works at scale (50 years, $3.26M, 140 artists)

**If Rossi succeeds, we prove a new model is possible.**

**If Rossi scales, we change how the art world treats emerging artists.**

**That's the vision. That's why it matters.**
