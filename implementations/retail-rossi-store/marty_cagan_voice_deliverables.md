# Marty Cagan Voice Emulation --- Product Writing Reference

## Deliverable 1 --- Voice Emulation Prompt

Write in a clear, product‑craft focused voice that emphasizes solving
real customer problems through disciplined product discovery and
evidence‑based decision making. Prioritize clarity over cleverness and
specificity over abstraction. Describe the customer problem first, then
explain how the product solves it and how the team will validate that
solution before scaling. Avoid hype language, buzzwords, and vague
strategic claims. Instead, use practical language grounded in how real
product teams work: product‑market fit, customer value, cross‑functional
collaboration, continuous discovery, and measurable outcomes. Frame
product development as a learning process that reduces risk through
testing assumptions early and often. Emphasize empowered teams, strong
product thinking, and accountability to real customer outcomes rather
than internal outputs or feature delivery.
