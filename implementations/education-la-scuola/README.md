# La Scuola International School — Archetype Program

**Project Type**: School Systems Architecture  
**Client**: La Scuola International School of San Francisco  
**Framework**: Palette Archetype System  
**Status**: Phase 1 — Structural Continuity Architecture

---

## Project Objective

Build a replicable School Systems Archetype that:
- Diagnoses structural continuity problems
- Designs institutional coherence frameworks
- Creates scalable curriculum architecture
- Validates high school feasibility

**Pilot**: La Scuola International School  
**Output**: Portable IP for private/IB/language immersion schools

## Three-Phase Approach

### Phase 1: Structural Continuity & Predictability Architecture (CURRENT)
- Diagnose structural breakdown
- Design coherence framework
- Create institutional memory systems

### Phase 2: Curriculum Architecture
- Italian program scope & sequence (K-8)
- Cross-disciplinary integration (IB PYP)
- Specialist integration model

### Phase 3: High School Strategic Design
- Validate HS feasibility against K-8 foundation
- Re-evaluate model selection
- Test structural alignment

## Palette Agents in Use

- **Argentavis (Argy)**: Research & diagnosis
- **Tyrannosaurus (Rex)**: Architecture design
- **Ankylosaurus (Anky)**: Validation

---

## Archive Contents

Prior work on high school feasibility:
- Model comparison (IB DP vs MYP+DP vs Custom)
- Feasibility analysis
- Architecture proposals
- One-pagers

**Note**: Phase 3 will re-evaluate these in light of K-8 structural findings.

**Current Phase**: Phase 1, Step 1 (Argy diagnostic complete)  
**Next**: Convergence cycle before architecture design
