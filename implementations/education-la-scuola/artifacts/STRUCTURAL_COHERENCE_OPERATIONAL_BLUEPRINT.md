## Operational Blueprint for Multi-Identity Integration

**Prepared by**: Claudia Canu, Grade 3 Teacher & Italian Program Coordinator  
**For**: Head of School & Assistant Head of School  
**Date**: February 2026

## GUIDING DESIGN PRINCIPLES

This framework integrates proven organizational methodologies to create:

- **Coherence without rigidity**: 50% standardized structures, 50% teacher autonomy
- **Predictability for children**: Consistent routines and expectations across grades enable self-management
- **Teacher autonomy within shared architecture**: Clear frameworks free teachers to innovate within boundaries
- **Vertical continuity**: Explicit progressions eliminate redundancy and gap-filling
- **Institutional memory**: Documented systems survive turnover and scale with growth

**Core Innovation**: We apply **Professional Learning Communities (PLC)**, **Understanding by Design (UbD)**, and **PDSA continuous improvement cycles** to operationalize IB + Reggio + Immersion integration.

## STRUCTURAL ARCHITECTURE MODEL

### LAYER 1: Institutional Direction (PLC Foundation)

**Methodology**: Professional Learning Communities (DuFour & Eaker)

**What La Scuola Implements**:
- **Vertical PLCs** (K-8 cross-grade teams): 2 half-days/year for curriculum alignment
- **Horizontal PLCs** (grade-level teams): Weekly 60-min structured meetings with rotating focus (planning, assessment, behavior, documentation)
- **Specialist Integration PLCs**: 45-min pre-UoI planning sessions (homeroom + specialists)
- **Shared leadership**: Italian Program Coordinator facilitates vertical alignment, Division Director owns horizontal coordination

**Concrete Action**: Establish protected PLC time in master schedule (non-sacrificeable for other initiatives)

---

### LAYER 2: Curriculum Alignment (UbD + Curriculum Mapping)

**Methodology**: Understanding by Design (Wiggins & McTighe) + Curriculum Mapping (Jacobs)

**What La Scuola Implements**:
- **Backward Design Protocol**: Start with end-of-year competencies (CEFR targets, IB concepts, self-management skills), then design assessments, then learning experiences
- **Vertical Curriculum Map** (K-8): Document "guaranteed curriculum" for each grade—what EVERY student masters before advancing
- **Horizontal Curriculum Map**: Align UoI across same-grade classrooms (50% common framework, 50% teacher-designed pathways)
- **Handoff Protocol**: June meetings between consecutive grades to transfer student-specific data and curriculum coverage

**Concrete Action**: Create Toddle-based curriculum map with CEFR progression (Pre-A1 → B2), IB concepts, and self-management rubrics

---

### LAYER 3: Collaboration Systems (Instructional Coaching Cycles)

**Methodology**: Instructional Coaching (Jim Knight's Impact Cycle) + Cognitive Coaching

**What La Scuola Implements**:
- **Peer Observation Cycles**: Teachers observe colleagues 2x/year with pre-conference (goal-setting), observation (evidence collection), post-conference (reflective feedback)
- **Co-Planning Sessions**: Homeroom + specialists co-design integrated learning experiences (not parallel teaching)
- **Instructional Rounds**: Leadership + teacher volunteers conduct quarterly classroom visits focused on specific instructional practice (e.g., "How do students demonstrate self-management?")
- **Coaching Partnerships**: Pair experienced teachers with new hires for first-year support

**Concrete Action**: Train 3-4 teacher-leaders in coaching protocols; pilot peer observation cycles with volunteers (Quick Win)

---

### LAYER 4: Classroom Systems (Responsive Classroom + Visible Learning)

**Methodology**: Responsive Classroom (NEFC) + Visible Learning (Hattie)

**What La Scuola Implements**:
- **Morning Meeting Protocol**: Standardized structure (greeting, sharing, activity, message) with teacher-designed content
- **Logical Consequences Framework**: 4-step progressive system tied to 4 Accordi (Responsibility, Respect, Collaboration, Empathy)
  - Step 1: Reflection (written + drawing)
  - Step 2: Reflection + Logical Consequence (loss of privilege, restorative action)
  - Step 3: Reflection + Consequence + Family communication
  - Step 4: Behavior plan with Learning Specialist
- **Self-Management Rubric**: Observable behaviors (organization, time management, task initiation) assessed quarterly
- **Predictable Routines**: Standardized transitions (arrival, snack, recess, lunch, dismissal) with grade-appropriate variations

**Concrete Action**: Implement progressive consequences framework K-8 (October 2026); create self-management rubric with teacher input

---

### LAYER 5: Documentation & Continuity (Knowledge Management + AI Tools)

**Methodology**: Knowledge Management Systems + AI-Assisted Documentation

**What La Scuola Implements**:
- **AI-Powered Documentation Workflow**: Voice-to-text → AI summary → Toddle upload (reduces documentation time from 30 min to 5-10 min)
- **End-of-Unit Reflection Template**: What was taught (vs planned), student engagement highlights, adjustments made, next steps
- **Student Progression Portfolio**: Quarterly evidence of CEFR level, IB concept understanding, self-management growth
- **Institutional Memory Protocol**: When teacher leaves, successor receives: curriculum coverage summary, student-specific notes, effective practices documentation
- **Decision Log**: Document pedagogical decisions (why we do X) so rationale survives turnover

**Concrete Action**: Train 5-6 volunteer teachers in AI tools (ChatGPT, Toddle AI); measure time savings; scale if successful

---

### LAYER 6: Data-Driven Improvement (PDSA Cycles)

**Methodology**: Plan-Do-Study-Act Continuous Improvement (Deming)

**What La Scuola Implements**:
- **Quarterly PDSA Cycles**: 
  - **Plan**: Identify problem (e.g., "Students take 15 min for simple tasks"), set measurable goal, design intervention
  - **Do**: Implement intervention with small group (pilot)
  - **Study**: Collect data (observation, student work, teacher feedback)
  - **Act**: Scale if successful, adjust if not, document learning
- **Data Walls** (teacher-facing, not public): Track progress on key metrics (CEFR levels, self-management rubric scores, behavioral incidents)
- **Formative Assessment Cycles**: Weekly exit tickets → analyze patterns → adjust instruction
- **Decision Gates**: After each phase (Quick Wins, Foundations, Scale), review data and decide Go/No-Go

**Concrete Action**: Pilot PDSA cycle with Italian vertical team (define CEFR progression K-8, assess current levels, identify gaps, design interventions)

---

## TENSIONS TO MANAGE

### Tension 1: Reggio Emergence vs Structural Predictability

**The Balance**: 
- **Structure**: IB central idea, lines of inquiry, CEFR targets (WHAT and WHY)
- **Emergence**: Pathways of exploration, materials, provocations (HOW and WHEN)
- **Resolution**: UoI framework is planned; children's questions and interests determine the journey within that framework

---

### Tension 2: Teacher Autonomy vs Institutional Alignment

**The Balance**:
- **Standardized (50%)**: Routines, behavioral expectations, end-of-year competencies, documentation protocols
- **Autonomous (50%)**: UoI implementation, materials selection, pedagogical style, pacing
- **Resolution**: "Tight on outcomes, loose on methods" — teachers have freedom within clear boundaries

---

### Tension 3: IB Compliance vs School Identity

**The Balance**:
- **IB Requires**: Vertical alignment, collaborative planning, documented curriculum, assessment
- **Reggio Requires**: Documentation, teacher collaboration, emergent curriculum, environment as third teacher
- **Resolution**: Both require structure; the tension is false. IB provides WHAT, Reggio provides HOW. This framework operationalizes both.

---

### Tension 4: Innovation vs Consistency

**The Balance**:
- **Consistency**: Predictable structures allow children to focus on learning (not adapting to new systems)
- **Innovation**: Teachers experiment within PDSA cycles, share successful practices in PLCs, scale what works
- **Resolution**: Innovation is systematic (test, measure, scale) not random. Consistency creates safety for experimentation.

---

### Tension 5: Time Investment vs Overwhelm

**The Balance**:
- **Year 1**: +13 hours (training, PLCs, new systems)
- **Year 2+**: -2 to -7 hours (AI savings, reduced gap-filling, efficient collaboration)
- **Resolution**: Front-load investment, back-load savings. Quick Wins demonstrate ROI before major commitment.

---

## CLEAR OUTCOME VISION

### What Continuity Looks Like for a Student (K-5)

A child moves from Kindergarten to Grade 5 and recognizes:
- **Familiar routines**: Morning Meeting structure, transition signals, self-management expectations
- **Progressive challenge**: Tasks build on prior learning (no redundancy, no gaps)
- **Linguistic growth**: Clear progression from Pre-A1 to B1, with visible milestones
- **Behavioral predictability**: Knows what happens when 4 Accordi are broken (consistent consequences)
- **Sense of belonging**: "This is how we do things at La Scuola" across classrooms and years

---

### What Collaboration Looks Like for Teachers

Teachers experience:
- **Vertical clarity**: Know exactly what students mastered last year and what they need this year
- **Horizontal alignment**: Grade-level team shares planning, discusses student progress, solves problems together
- **Specialist integration**: Co-plan with specialists, see connections in student learning
- **Peer learning**: Observe colleagues, receive coaching, share successful practices in PLCs
- **Reduced overwhelm**: AI tools reduce documentation time, clear curriculum map reduces planning time, collaboration reduces isolation

---

### What Predictability Looks Like Inside Classrooms

Classrooms have:
- **Consistent structures**: Morning Meeting, transition routines, self-management systems recognizable across rooms
- **Flexible content**: Teachers design UoI pathways, choose materials, respond to student interests
- **Observable expectations**: Self-management rubric visible, 4 Accordi posted, logical consequences understood
- **Documentation rhythm**: Weekly reflections (5-10 min with AI), quarterly portfolios, end-of-unit summaries
- **Student agency**: Within predictable structures, students make choices, pursue interests, express through 100 languages

---

### What Institutional Memory Looks Like Year to Year

The school demonstrates:
- **Curriculum continuity**: New teachers access documented scope & sequence, unit plans, assessment data
- **Knowledge transfer**: When teacher leaves, successor receives comprehensive handoff (not starting from zero)
- **Learning from experience**: PDSA cycles document what works, PLCs share successful practices, Toddle archives institutional knowledge
- **Scalable systems**: Structures work with 100 students or 200 students (not dependent on informal relationships)
- **Leadership succession**: Systems survive leadership changes because they're documented and embedded

---
