AI Outcomes Manager
Remote - US

About Glean:

Founded in 2019, Glean is an innovative AI-powered knowledge management platform designed to help organizations quickly find, organize, and share information across their teams. By integrating seamlessly with tools like Google Drive, Slack, and Microsoft Teams, Glean ensures employees can access the right knowledge at the right time, boosting productivity and collaboration. The company’s cutting-edge AI technology simplifies knowledge discovery, making it faster and more efficient for teams to leverage their collective intelligence.

Glean was born from Founder & CEO Arvind Jain’s deep understanding of the challenges employees face in finding and understanding information at work. Seeing firsthand how fragmented knowledge and sprawling SaaS tools made it difficult to stay productive, he set out to build a better way - an AI-powered enterprise search platform that helps people quickly and intuitively access the information they need. Since then, Glean has evolved into the leading Work AI platform, combining enterprise-grade search, an AI assistant, and powerful application- and agent-building capabilities to fundamentally redefine how employees work.
