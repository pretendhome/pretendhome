## YOUR 30-SECOND PITCH

"I built Palette — a three-tier agentic system — over 2.5 years at AWS. It's shipping real outcomes across three active projects. Before that, I drove GenAI partnerships at AWS, launching 27+ models and growing Stability AI 5X YoY. I'm good at translating customer problems into AI solutions, building with customers, and measuring outcomes. That's what Glean needs."

### AWS GenAI Partnerships (LLM Expertise)
- 27+ models launched on Bedrock
- Stability AI: 5X YoY growth

## 4-QUESTION FRAMEWORK (USE THIS IN DEMO)

1. **Is there a pattern?** (Same problem across multiple users)
2. **Is there data?** (Past examples, documents, structured data)
3. **Is it repetitive?** (Happens frequently enough to justify automation)
4. **Can you measure success?** (Clear metrics: time saved, accuracy, satisfaction)

If yes to all four → good fit for AI

---

## DEMO SCENARIO STRUCTURE

**Step 1: Discovery (5-10 min)**
- What does success mean to you?
- What's the current process?
- Where do users spend the most time?
- What data do you have?
- How do you measure success today?

**Step 2: Problem Framing (5 min)**
- Apply 4-question framework
- Synthesize what you heard
- Propose success metrics (Phase 1, 2, 3)

**Step 3: Solution Design (10 min)**
- Input: What does the user provide?
- Retrieval: What data does the agent need?
- Generation: What does the agent produce?
- Human-in-the-loop: Where does the user review?

**Step 4: Pilot Scoping (5 min)**
- 12 weeks, 5-10 users
- Success criteria (80%+ usage, 50%+ time savings, 4.5+ satisfaction)
- Kill criteria (<50% usage, <30% time savings, <4.0 satisfaction)

**Step 5: Rollout (Ongoing)**
- Expand to full team if metrics hit targets
- Add new capabilities
- Measure business outcomes
- Iterate based on feedback

## TOP 5 INTERVIEW QUESTIONS & ANSWERS

### Q1: "Tell me about a time you shipped an AI outcome, not just a demo."
**A**: Palette — 105 RIUs, 93 knowledge library entries, 7 production agents, 3 active projects. Has promotion/demotion logic (UNVALIDATED → WORKING → PRODUCTION). That's production, not a demo.

### Q2: "How do you know what LLMs can and cannot do?"
**A**: AWS GenAI partnerships — 27+ models launched, Stability AI 5X YoY growth. LLMs are great at pattern recognition, summarization, RAG, structured output. They struggle with math, reasoning over long contexts, real-time data, deterministic outputs. Always use human-in-the-loop for high-stakes decisions.

### Q3: "Walk me through how you'd design an AI agent for a customer."
**A**: Use 4-question framework (pattern, data, repetitive, measurable). Design agent workflow (input → retrieval → generation → human-in-the-loop). Scope pilot (12 weeks, 5-10 users, clear success metrics, kill criteria).

### Q4: "How do you handle customers who want AI to do everything?"
**A**: Set expectations early. Use 4-question framework to filter out bad use cases. Push back on high-risk use cases. Steer customers toward high-value, low-risk use cases first.

### Q5: "Why Glean? Why this role?"
**A**: Glean is solving the right problem (enterprise search is broken). This role is the perfect fit (design AI agents, work with customers, ship outcomes). I want to work with customers (100% customer-facing, where I thrive).

## RED FLAGS TO WATCH FOR

1. **No clear success metrics** → Role is ambiguous
2. **No Product/R&D collaboration** → You're just implementing, not influencing
3. **No customer examples** → Product might not be working
4. **Unrealistic expectations** → They expect you to "transform every department" in 90 days
5. **No kill criteria** → They'll waste time and money on bad pilots
