## APPROACH

### Different from Gap:
- **Streamlined research** (6 docs vs. 8+ docs) — AI/SaaS is familiar domain
- **Tactical frameworks** (customer engagement, agent design) vs. strategic frameworks (enterprise transformation)
- **Executor positioning** (shipped outcomes) vs. enabler positioning (domain-agnostic methodology)
- **Modular materials** (7 separate docs) vs. monolithic (1-2 large docs)

### Same as Gap:
- **Core narrative**: Palette, AWS GenAI, AWS Public Sector
- **4-Question Framework**: Pattern, data, repetitive, measurable
- **Demo scenario structure**: Discovery → design → pilot → rollout
- **Success metrics**: Usage, efficiency, business outcomes

---

## KEY DELIVERABLES

### 1. Opening Statement (2 versions)
**30-second version**:
"I built Palette — a three-tier agentic system — over 2.5 years at AWS. It's shipping real outcomes across three active projects. Before that, I drove GenAI partnerships at AWS, launching 27+ models and growing Stability AI 5X YoY. I'm good at translating customer problems into AI solutions, building with customers, and measuring outcomes. That's what Glean needs."

**2-minute version**: Expands with Palette details, AWS proof points, customer-facing experience

### 2. Demo Scenario (Working with a Glean Customer)
**Structure**:
- Step 1: Discovery (5-10 min) — Ask 5 key questions
- Step 2: Problem Framing (5 min) — Apply 4-question framework
- Step 3: Solution Design (10 min) — Design agent workflow
- Step 4: Pilot Scoping (5 min) — 12 weeks, 5-10 users, success/kill criteria
- Step 5: Rollout (Ongoing) — Expand, iterate, measure

### 3. Interview Q&A (10 questions)
1. Tell me about a time you shipped an AI outcome, not just a demo
2. How do you know what LLMs can and cannot do?
3. Walk me through how you'd design an AI agent for a customer
4. How do you handle customers who want AI to do everything?
5. Tell me about a time you worked with executives and end users
6. How do you measure AI outcomes?
7. What's your experience with prompt engineering and AI agents?
8. How do you handle AI failures or hallucinations?
9. Why Glean? Why this role?
10. What's your 30-60-90 day plan?

### 4. Glean Company Intel
- Founded 2019 by Arvind Jain (ex-Google search infrastructure)
- $360M+ raised, $2.2B valuation (Series D, 2024)
- Product: AI-powered enterprise search + AI assistant + agent builder
- Customers: 500-5,000 employees (sweet spot), tech/financial services/healthcare
- Top use cases: Sales enablement (30%), customer support (25%), engineering (20%)
- Competitors: Microsoft Copilot, Google Duet AI, Notion AI, Perplexity
- Differentiation: Best-in-class search across all tools, agent builder, enterprise-grade

### 5. Palette Demo Script (10-15 minutes)
**Real example**: Interview prep project
- Problem: Prepare 30-min demo in 20 min (vs. 4-6 hours manually)
- Multi-agent workflow: Yuty → Argy → Theri → Anky
- Outcome: Complete interview prep package (demo script, slide outline, scenarios, frameworks)
- Proof: Production-ready (promotion/demotion logic), used in real interview

### 6. Methodology Comparison (Gap vs. Glean)
**5-phase process**:
1. Foundation & Positioning (30 min)
2. Deep Research (1-2 hours)
3. Strategic Frameworks (1-2 hours)
4. Validation (30 min)
5. Interview Prep (1-2 hours)

**Key lessons**:
- Tailor positioning to role type (enabler vs. executor)
- Research depth depends on domain familiarity
- Frameworks should match role complexity
- Proof points are reusable (same proof points, different framing)
- Demo scenarios are critical
- Materials should be modular (easier to navigate and rehearse)

### What Changed:
- **Positioning**: Enabler (Gap) → Executor (Glean)
- **Research depth**: Deep (Gap) → Streamlined (Glean)
- **Framework complexity**: Strategic (Gap) → Tactical (Glean)
- **Materials structure**: Monolithic (Gap) → Modular (Glean)

### What Stayed the Same:
