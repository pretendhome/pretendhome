- **Title**: Senior Technical and GTM Recruiter at Glean (since Jan 2025, 1+ year)
- **Background**: 10+ years full-lifecycle recruiting
  - **Amazon** (5 yrs, 2016-2021) — SDEs, Front-End Engineers, SDMs, TPMs for Consumer & AWS
  - **Meta** (1.5 yrs) — Product Managers, Technical Program Managers
  - **Pinecone** (1.5 yrs) — Director-level and IC roles across GTM, Marketing, Product, Engineering (vector DB company — she knows AI)
  - **Glean** (1+ yr) — Senior Technical and GTM Recruiter
- **Education**: BS Marketing, Clemson University
- **Location**: Austin, Texas
- **Style**: Polished, efficient, direct. Decade of senior recruiting at FAANG. She's seen thousands of candidates.
- **AI fluency**: High for a recruiter. Recruited for Pinecone (vector DB), now Glean. She understands the AI landscape.
- **Key detail**: She posted the AI Outcomes Manager role herself on LinkedIn, describing it as "adoption, time-to-value, and ROI... partner with exec sponsors and power users, craft success plans, and orchestrate cross-functional adoption"

### CONNECTION: You Both Worked at Amazon (2016-2021)
- **Mical at AWS**: Knowledge Architecture, GenAI Partnerships, Public Sector Analytics GTM
- **Allie at Amazon**: Technical Recruiter → Senior Technical Recruiter (Consumer & AWS)
- **Overlap**: July 2016 - October 2021 (~5 years)
- **USE THIS**: Mention Amazon naturally. "When I was at AWS..." — she'll feel an instant connection. Don't force it, but don't miss it either.

### Zachary Brown — Support Role
- **Title**: Associate Post Sales Recruiter at Glean (started Feb 2026, contract, ~1 month in)
- **Background**: 4+ years campus recruiting at AMD
- **Role in this interview**: Likely observing, taking notes, learning. May ask a follow-up question or two.

### What This Dual-Interviewer Setup Means
- **Allie drives**. She'll ask the substantive questions. She's calibrated — she knows what strong looks like.
- **Zachary observes**. He may ask a softer question or handle logistics. He's learning the req.
- **Allie can go deeper** than a typical recruiter — she recruited for Pinecone and has been at Glean for a year. She may ask about agent design, customer engagement specifics, or how you'd approach adoption.
- **Don't dumb it down** — Allie can follow technical concepts at a product level. Just don't go into implementation weeds.

## SIMULATION INSTRUCTIONS

**To run this simulation**: The AI plays Allie Zolno as the lead interviewer — professional, efficient, warm but evaluative. Zachary may chime in occasionally. Ask questions in order but allow natural conversation flow. Allie will probe deeper on strong answers and redirect on weak ones.

## INTERVIEW FLOW (30-45 MINUTES)

### Phase 1: Warm-Up (3-5 minutes)

**Allie's opening**: "Hi Mical, thanks for joining us! I'm Allie, Senior Recruiter here at Glean — I focus on our GTM and post-sales hiring. And Zachary is here with me as well."

**Zachary**: "Hey Mical, good to meet you!"

**Allie**: "So I've had a chance to look through your resume and I'm really excited to chat. I'll ask some questions about your background and the role, and then we'll save time at the end for your questions. Sound good?"

**Rapport opportunity**: If it comes up naturally — "I noticed you were at AWS — I was actually at Amazon from 2016 to 2021, so we overlapped!"

---

### Phase 2: Background & Motivation (10 minutes)

**Q1**: "Walk me through your background and what's brought you to this point."
- **What Allie's listening for**: Clear narrative thread, relevant experience, confidence. She's seen thousands of candidates — she can tell in 60 seconds if someone has a story or is winging it.
- **Good signals**: Palette → AWS GenAI → AWS Public Sector, under 2 minutes, ends with why Glean
- **Red flag**: Chronological resume recitation, no connection to the role

**Q2**: "What specifically drew you to the AI Outcomes Manager role at Glean?"
- **What Allie's listening for**: Did they do real research? Do they understand what this role IS?
- **Good signals**: References agent builder, customer outcomes, $200M ARR growth, "this is what I've been building toward"
- **Red flag**: Generic "I love AI" answer. She'll mentally check out.
- **Allie may probe**: "What do you think the biggest challenge would be in this role?"

**Q3**: "What do you know about Glean's platform and where we're headed?"
- **What Allie's listening for**: Product understanding beyond the homepage. She's been here a year — she knows the product well.
- **Good signals**: Enterprise search + AI assistant + agent builder, mentions Glean Agents (100M+ actions), $200M ARR, Gartner recognition
- **Bonus points**: Mention the agent builder's evolution — unified builder, graph-based + conversational creation, Fast/Thinking modes

---

### Phase 3: Experience Validation (12-15 minutes)

**Q4**: "This role is very customer-facing — you're partnering with executives and end users. Tell me about your experience doing that kind of work."
- **What Allie's listening for**: Concrete examples with outcomes, comfort with senior stakeholders
- **Good signals**: AWS Data Leadership Forum (291+ data leaders, 98+ CxOs), enablement programs (+17% attendance, +50% high-CSAT), "I built the forum from scratch"
- **Allie may probe**: "How did you tailor your approach between executives and individual contributors?"

**Q5**: "The JD says 'shipped outcomes, not just demos.' Can you give me a concrete example of an AI outcome you've shipped?"
- **What Allie's listening for**: This is THE question. She's heard "I built a chatbot" a hundred times. She wants specifics.
- **Good signals**: Palette — 105 validated problem-solution pairs, 7 production agents, 3 active projects with real users. Promotion/demotion logic. Measurable outcomes.
- **Keep it tight**: 90 seconds. She doesn't need the three-tier architecture deep dive. She needs: what did you build, who used it, what was the outcome.
- **Allie may probe**: "What made that a production system vs. a prototype?"

**Q6**: "How comfortable are you working hands-on with AI platforms — building agents, crafting prompts, that kind of thing?"
- **What Allie's listening for**: Hands-on vs. managerial. This role builds WITH customers.
- **Good signals**: "I built Palette myself — 7 agent archetypes, each with specific roles. At AWS I launched 27+ models on Bedrock. I'm hands-on, not just strategic."
- **Red flag**: All strategy, no building

**Q7** (Allie's deeper probe — she may ask this because of her Pinecone/AI background):
"How do you think about what makes a good AI use case vs. a bad one? How would you help a customer figure that out?"
- **What Allie's listening for**: Framework thinking. Can this person help customers cut through the hype?
- **Good signals**: 4-Question Framework (pattern, data, repetitive, measurable). Concrete example of applying it.
- **This is where you shine**: Quick framework + real example = "hire this person"

---

### Phase 4: Logistics & Comp (5 minutes)

**Q8**: "The role is remote US — you're based in San Francisco, right? That work for you?"
- **Answer**: Yes, San Francisco, fully comfortable remote

**Q9**: "What are you looking for in terms of compensation?"
- **What Allie's listening for**: Are they in range? She knows the band ($130K-$200K OTE).
- **Note**: Allie is experienced — she may ask directly. Don't dodge, but don't anchor low.
- **Good approach**: "Based on my experience and the scope of the role, I'd expect to be in the upper portion of the range. But I'm most focused on the right fit and the total package including equity."

**Q10**: "Where else are you in the process? Any timelines we should be aware of?"
- **What Allie's listening for**: Competitive urgency. She's managed hiring pipelines at Amazon and Meta — she knows the game.
- **Good approach**: Be honest. "I'm actively interviewing for a few roles in the AI space" creates healthy urgency without pressure.

**Q11**: "When could you start if everything moves forward?"
- **Good approach**: "I'm available immediately / within 2 weeks."

### Phase 5: Candidate Questions (5-7 minutes)

**Allie**: "Great — those are my questions. What do you have for us?"

**Best questions for Allie** (she can answer these — she's been at Glean a year and owns this req):
1. "What does the interview process look like from here? How many rounds and who would I be meeting?"
2. "How is the AI Outcomes team structured? How many people are in this function currently?"
3. "What's the profile of people who've been successful in similar roles at Glean?"
4. "I noticed Glean just hit $200M ARR and launched Glean Agents — how is that changing what this role looks like day-to-day?"
5. "You've been at Glean about a year now — what's surprised you most about the company?"

**Amazon connection question** (if rapport was established):
- "We both came through Amazon — what made you decide to join Glean?"

**Questions to SAVE for the hiring manager**:
- Deep product architecture / agent builder technical questions
- Specific customer engagement playbooks
- Strategic direction and competitive positioning details
- Team reporting structure specifics

---

### Close

**Allie's close**: "Mical, this has been a great conversation. I'm going to sync up with the hiring team and get back to you on next steps — typically within [X business days]. Is there anything else you'd like us to know?"

**Your close**: End with enthusiasm and specificity. Not "Thanks, this was great" but: "I'm really excited about this — the combination of building AI agents and working directly with customers is exactly what I've been doing, and doing it at Glean's scale would be incredible."

## TIPS FOR THIS SPECIFIC INTERVIEW

1. **Allie is sharp** — Don't underestimate her. She recruited for Pinecone (vector DB) and has been at Glean a year. She understands AI at a product level and will notice if you're bluffing.
2. **Lead with the Amazon connection** — You overlapped 5 years. This is free rapport. Use it naturally: "When I was at AWS..." She'll connect instantly.
3. **90-second answers** — Allie has run thousands of screens. She values conciseness. Say the thing, give the proof point, stop.
4. **Hit the JD keywords she used in her own LinkedIn post**: "adoption," "time-to-value," "ROI," "exec sponsors," "power users," "success plans," "cross-functional adoption." These are the words she'll listen for.
5. **Show you build, not just strategize** — Her LinkedIn post distinguishes this role (AI Outcomes = build) from the Delivery Excellence Manager role (= project management). She wants a builder.
6. **Don't over-explain Palette** — "I built a production agentic system with 7 agents shipping real outcomes across 3 active projects" is enough for this round. Save the architecture for the hiring manager.
7. **Ask her about Glean** — She's been there a year and is clearly proud of the $200M ARR milestone (she reposted it). Let her sell you on the company.
8. **Comp: be direct but flexible** — Allie has negotiated comp at Amazon and Meta. She respects directness. "Upper portion of the range, focused on total package" is the right tone.
9. **Zachary is learning** — Be equally warm to him. Allie will notice how you treat the junior person on the call.
10. **Close with specificity** — Not "this was great." Say exactly WHY you're excited about THIS role at THIS company. Allie will write that in her notes.
