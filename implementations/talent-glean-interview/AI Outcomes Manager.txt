AI Outcomes Manager
Remote - US

About Glean:

Founded in 2019, Glean is an innovative AI-powered knowledge management platform designed to help organizations quickly find, organize, and share information across their teams. By integrating seamlessly with tools like Google Drive, Slack, and Microsoft Teams, Glean ensures employees can access the right knowledge at the right time, boosting productivity and collaboration. The company’s cutting-edge AI technology simplifies knowledge discovery, making it faster and more efficient for teams to leverage their collective intelligence.

Glean was born from Founder & CEO Arvind Jain’s deep understanding of the challenges employees face in finding and understanding information at work. Seeing firsthand how fragmented knowledge and sprawling SaaS tools made it difficult to stay productive, he set out to build a better way - an AI-powered enterprise search platform that helps people quickly and intuitively access the information they need. Since then, Glean has evolved into the leading Work AI platform, combining enterprise-grade search, an AI assistant, and powerful application- and agent-building capabilities to fundamentally redefine how employees work.
About the Role:

Glean is seeking a talented AI Outcomes Manager to join our rapidly expanding team. The AI Outcomes Manager will play a crucial role in transforming how every department works, with the power of Glean. They will work closely with executives and end users, combining business acumen, product sense, and prompting skills to help them transform into an AI-native enterprise.
You will:

    Partner with executive sponsors and end users to identify high‑impact use cases and turn them into measurable business outcomes on Glean.
    Lead strategic reviews and advise customers on their AI roadmap, ensuring they get the most value from Glean’s platform.
    Translate business needs into clear problem statements, success metrics, and practical AI solutions; collaborate with Product and R&D to shape priorities.
    Conduct discovery workshops, scope pilots, and guide rollouts, driving breadth and depth of adoption of the Glean platform.
    Design and build AI agents with and for customers, including rethinking and redesigning underlying business processes to maximize impact and usability.
    Proactively identify expansion opportunities and drive engagement across teams and functions.

About you:

    5+ years of professional experience in roles that blend business and technology (e.g., product, analytics, data, engineering, solutions), with a consultative, customer‑facing approach.
    Strong problem‑solving and communication skills; comfortable working with stakeholders from ICs to executives and tailoring messages to different audiences.
    Demonstrated ability to craft effective prompts and guide AI agents for real customer or business workflows; you’ve shipped outcomes, not just demos.
    Understanding of what current LLMs can and cannot do; able to set expectations and steer towards reliable, safe, cost‑effective solutions.
    Product sense and user empathy—you can spot high‑value applications of AI across diverse job functions and design clear, guided experiences.
    Hands‑on experience with modern AI platforms and tools (e.g., OpenAI, Claude, Mistral, Cohere or similar), with enough technical depth to work with engineers without needing to be on the critical path for writing production code.

Good to have:

    Prior experience in customer‑facing, consultative roles (solutions, support, product management) and comfort presenting to senior leaders.
    Exposure to evaluating AI outcomes (e.g., defining success criteria, using sample tasks, reviewing results) and iterating for quality, latency, and cost.
    Ability to analyze usage signals and customer feedback to inform roadmap and drive adoption.

Location:

    This role is remote in the U.S.

Compensation & Benefits:

The standard OTE range for this position is $130,000-$200,000 annually. Compensation offered will be determined by factors such as location, level, job-related knowledge, skills, and experience. Certain roles may be eligible for variable compensation, equity, and benefits.

We are a diverse bunch of people and we want to continue to attract and retain a diverse range of people into our organization. We're committed to an inclusive and diverse company. We do not discriminate based on gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, civil or family status, age, disability, or race.

A huge thank-you to our Community Relations team for organizing another impactful volunteer event with our nonprofit partner, Rise Against Hunger! Our Austin and Boxborough interns came together to assemble nutritious meals that will be distributed to communities facing food insecurity due to economic challenges, environmental pressures, and in response to disasters and emergencies around the world.
We’re especially proud to share that, with their help, AMD packed its 1,000,000th meal! Thank you to all our amazing interns for giving back and making a difference.

🎉 We’ve surpassed $200M in annual recurring revenue (ARR) – doubling it just nine months after we achieved $100M ARR as enterprises move from AI pilots to real, scaled outcomes.

This milestone reflects the dedication of our team and, most importantly, the trust of our customers, partners, and community. We couldn’t have done this without you. 💙

That’s why every day, employees around the world rely on Glean to make better decisions and get work done faster.

A few highlights from the journey:
🚀 Shipped 200 product innovations this year 
📂 Indexed more than 27B documents since inception
📈 More than doubled customer deployments worldwide, with industry-leading engagement (40% wDAU/wMAU)
🤝 Expanded our strategic partner ecosystem with new and deepened collaborations with Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google, Microsoft, Databricks, Dell Technologies, Palo Alto Networks, Snowflake, Workday, and Zoom
📊 Surpassed a 20T tokens-per-year run rate, with consumption doubling last quarter and cementing Glean as one of the highest-scale enterprise users of foundation models across search, assistant, and agentic workflows

Our mission to expand human potential to do extraordinary work is entering its next chapter, and we’re incredibly grateful to have you on this journey with us.

Today, organizations rely on Glean for:
🔎 Generative AI–powered, context-aware search, built on our Enterprise Graph for deep understanding and rich retrieval
 🌐 A unified Work AI platform connecting to 100+ enterprise SaaS apps and securely reasoning over organizational knowledge in real time

 🚀 Deeply integrated agentic automation and custom AI agents, powered by Agentic Engine 2, enabling teams to automate processes, accelerate decisions, and drive measurable productivity across every function — from sales and support to engineering, HR, and beyond

Thank you to all of our customers, partners, and community for your support. 💙

Hi everyone,

I wanted to share some personal news- I was recently affected by the latest round of layoffs at Amazon. While this is unexpected, I’m grateful for the experiences I’ve had, the talented people I’ve worked alongside, and the growth I’ve achieved during my time there.

As I take the next step in my career, I’m excited to have conversations with anyone who might positively affect my search for a new role.  

If you know of any opportunities in HR or Talent that might be a good fit for me, I would appreciate any and all introductions. And of course, I’m always happy to connect and pay it forward however I can.

Let’s call a spade a spade:  it’s been a tough year for the Meagher family, but we’re poised for a huge 2026!  

Thank you to everyone who’s reached out with support- it means a lot. 💛
