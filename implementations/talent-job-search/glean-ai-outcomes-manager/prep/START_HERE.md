## YOUR CORE NARRATIVE (MEMORIZE THIS)

"I built Palette — a three-tier agentic system — over 2.5 years at AWS. It's shipping real outcomes across three active projects. Before that, I drove GenAI partnerships at AWS, launching 27+ models and growing Stability AI 5X YoY. I'm good at translating customer problems into AI solutions, building with customers, and measuring outcomes. That's what Glean needs."

---

## YOUR PROOF POINTS

### Palette (AI Outcomes Shipped)
- 105 validated problem-solution pairs (RIUs)
- 93 knowledge library entries with sources
- 7 production agents with promotion/demotion logic
- 3 active projects: teaching, business planning, game dev

### AWS GenAI Partnerships (LLM Expertise)
- 27+ models launched on Bedrock
- Stability AI: 5X YoY growth
- 500+ field sellers enabled

### AWS Public Sector (Customer-Facing)
- 24% YoY growth
- 291+ data leaders, 98+ CxOs
- +17% attendance, +50% high-CSAT sessions

---

## 4-QUESTION FRAMEWORK (USE IN DEMO)

1. **Is there a pattern?** (Same problem across multiple users)
2. **Is there data?** (Past examples, documents, structured data)
3. **Is it repetitive?** (Happens frequently enough to justify automation)
4. **Can you measure success?** (Clear metrics: time saved, accuracy, satisfaction)

If yes to all four → good fit for AI

---

## DEMO SCENARIO STRUCTURE

**Step 1: Discovery** (5-10 min)
- What does success mean to you?
- What's the current process?
- Where do users spend the most time?
- What data do you have?
- How do you measure success today?

**Step 2: Problem Framing** (5 min)
- Apply 4-question framework
- Synthesize what you heard
- Propose success metrics

**Step 3: Solution Design** (10 min)
- Input: What does the user provide?
- Retrieval: What data does the agent need?
- Generation: What does the agent produce?
- Human-in-the-loop: Where does the user review?

**Step 4: Pilot Scoping** (5 min)
- 12 weeks, 5-10 users
- Success criteria: 80%+ usage, 50%+ time savings, 4.5+ satisfaction
- Kill criteria: <50% usage, <30% time savings, <4.0 satisfaction

## TOP 3 QUESTIONS THEY'LL ASK

### Q1: "Tell me about a time you shipped an AI outcome, not just a demo."
**A**: Palette — 105 RIUs, 93 knowledge library entries, 7 production agents, 3 active projects. Has promotion/demotion logic. That's production, not a demo.

### Q2: "How do you know what LLMs can and cannot do?"
**A**: AWS GenAI partnerships — 27+ models launched, Stability AI 5X YoY growth. LLMs are great at pattern recognition, summarization, RAG. They struggle with math, reasoning, real-time data. Always use human-in-the-loop for high-stakes decisions.

### Q3: "Walk me through how you'd design an AI agent for a customer."
**A**: Use 4-question framework. Design agent workflow (input → retrieval → generation → human-in-the-loop). Scope pilot (12 weeks, 5-10 users, clear success metrics, kill criteria).

## WHAT I BUILT LAST NIGHT

I followed the same process we used for Gap, but adapted it for Glean:

**Gap** (Internal transformation strategy):
- Deep research (8+ documents, 150KB)
- Strategic frameworks (enterprise transformation, governance, ROI)
- Enabler positioning (domain-agnostic methodology)

**Glean** (External customer outcomes delivery):
- Streamlined research (6 documents, 80KB)
- Tactical frameworks (customer engagement, agent design, pilot scoping)
- Executor positioning (shipped outcomes, not demos)

**What stayed the same**:
- Core narrative (Palette, AWS GenAI, AWS Public Sector)
- 4-Question Framework (pattern, data, repetitive, measurable)
- Demo scenario structure (discovery → design → pilot → rollout)
- Success metrics (usage, efficiency, business outcomes)

**What changed**:
- Positioning (enabler → executor)
- Research depth (deep → streamlined)
- Framework complexity (strategic → tactical)

---

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Read README.md** (start there, it has the full 2-hour prep plan)
2. **Rehearse out loud** (opening statement 3X, demo scenario 2X, top 5 questions 1X each)
3. **Print cheat sheet** (keep it handy during interview)
4. **Trust the process** (you're prepared, you've got this)

---

**You've got this!** 🚀

**Remember**: You're not just applying for a job — you're showing Glean how you can help their customers ship AI outcomes. That's what you do best.
