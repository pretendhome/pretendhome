---

## Convergence Brief

**Goal**: Build a system where anyone can input their savings and get a Buffett-aligned retirement strategy

**Roles**:
- Yuty: Extract framework from transcript, define allocation rules
- Argy: Research current market conditions, platforms, tax implications
- Rex: Design allocation strategy, rebalancing rules, decision tree
- Theri: Build monitoring dashboard + alert system
- Anky: Validate against Buffett principles, stress test

**Capabilities**: 
- Parse Buffett transcript for decision criteria
- Real-time market data (dividend yields, TIPS rates, cap rates)
- Age-aware allocation (30s vs. 50s vs. 60s)
- Alert system for rebalancing and opportunities

**Constraints**:
- Must follow Buffett's 5 assets (no crypto, no speculation)
- Must be simple (no complex derivatives)
- Must work for any dollar amount ($10K to $10M)

**Non-goals**:
- NOT tax optimization software (just awareness)
- NOT active trading system (buy and hold)
- NOT financial advice (educational tool)

**Success Criteria**:
- Input $500K at age 45 → Output specific allocation
- Dashboard shows when to rebalance
- Alerts trigger on opportunities (market crash, high yields)
