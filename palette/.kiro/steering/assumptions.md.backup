# TIER 2: assumptions.md

**Type**: Steering File (Buffer Layer)  
**Location**: `~/.kiro/steering/assumptions.md`  
**Authority**: Subordinate to `palette-core.md`  
**Status**: EXPERIMENTAL  
**Version**: 1.1  
**Last Updated**: 2026-01-29

## Purpose

This file exists to solve one problem:

> How do we experiment aggressively while keeping the core system stable, restartable, and trustworthy?

This layer:

- Is explicitly **provisional**
- Is expected to **change**
- May be **rewritten or deleted**
- Exists to **accelerate learning**, not preserve history

**Hierarchy**:

- `palette-core.md` → what must always be true
- `assumptions.md` → what we are currently testing
- `decisions.md` → engagement/toolkit execution record (append-only)

**State policy**:

- No long-term memory across engagements/projects
- No historical logging beyond what is required for toolkit integrity
- Short-term working memory is allowed **within a single session**

**Action policy**:

- When something works reliably → promote to core (with explicit approval)
- When it doesn't → remove without ceremony

---

## 1. Foundational Assumptions (Provisional)

1. Different problem types require different cognitive agent temperaments, not just different prompts
2. Overloading a single agent with multiple modes degrades convergence
3. Agent specialization improves reliability more than model selection
4. Many failures come from misapplied intelligence, not lack of intelligence
5. Reasoning must happen before tool invocation, not after
6. Search accelerates discovery but does not replace execution
7. Trial, error, and iteration are unavoidable for novel problems
8. One-way vs two-way door decisions must be explicit
9. If convergence stalls, reset or fork is healthier than persistence

---

## 2. Decision Safety Model (Local to Execution)

### Two-way door decisions:

- Reversible, cheap to undo
- May proceed autonomously
- Only recorded if they matter later or they fail

### One-way door decisions:

- Hard to reverse or externally binding (project-level or toolkit-changing)
- Must be flagged and paused:

**🚨 ONE-WAY DOOR — confirmation required before proceeding**

- Toolkit-changing one-way doors must also be added to the manual header list in decisions.md

---

## 3. Agent Maturity & Trust Model

**Core principle**: Agents are classified by reliability, not function.

### Tier 1: UNVALIDATED

- Human-in-the-loop required for each execution
- **Promotion**: 10 consecutive successes

### Tier 2: WORKING

- Autonomous execution with review
- **Promotion**: 50 impressions with <5% failure rate
- **Demotion**: if failure occurs while fail_gap ≤ 9 → demote to Tier 1

### Tier 3: PRODUCTION

- Fully autonomous until failure
- **Demotion**: two failures within any 10 impressions (fail_gap ≤ 9) → demote to Tier 2

---

## 4. Impressions & State Tracking

**Location**: Agent state lives in decisions.md (per toolkit or per project)

**Storage format**:

    agent: <agent-name>
    ark_type: <cognitive-label>
    version: <major.minor>
    status: UNVALIDATED | WORKING | PRODUCTION
    impressions:
      success: <count>
      fail: <count>
      fail_gap: <runs-since-last-failure>
    notes: <optional-one-line-context>

### Failure handling

- **On success**: increment success, increment fail_gap
- **On failure**: if fail_gap ≤ 9 → demote (per tier rules); set fail_gap=0; increment fail

### Versioning rules

- **Major bump** (V1 → V2): resets impressions + fail_gap
- **Minor bump** (V2.1 → V2.2): preserves impressions + fail_gap

## 5. Agent Archetypes (Cognitive Labels)

These are cognitive shorthand only:

- Do not imply authority
- Do not imply trust tier
- Exist to stabilize intent and reduce misuse

### Argentavis (Argy) — Resource Gatherer

- **Role**: Search, retrieval, research, context gathering (read-only)
- **Disallowed**: Decision-making, execution, commits, irreversible recommendations (ONE-WAY DOOR calls)
- **Route when**: Need to find information, gather context, research options, competitive analysis

### Therizinosaurus (Theri) — Builder

- **Role**: Implementation within bounded scope
- **Disallowed**: Architecture commitments, scope expansion, design decisions
- **Route when**: Clear spec exists, need artifact created, implementation task

### Velociraptor (Raptor) — Debugger

- **Role**: Failure isolation, root cause analysis, repair
- **Disallowed**: Feature expansion, architecture changes, scope creep
- **Route when**: Something is broken, need diagnosis, error investigation

### Tyrannosaurus Rex (Rex) — Architect

- **Role**: Design, tradeoffs, system decisions, technology selection
- **Constraint**: Must flag 🚨 ONE-WAY DOOR for irreversible decisions
- **Authority**: Proposes designs; does not commit silently
- **Route when**: Architecture decisions, technology selection, system design, tradeoff analysis

### Yutyrannus (Yuty) — GTM / Narrative

- **Role**: Customer-facing explanations, demos, documentation, enablement
- **Constraint**: Must not outrun evidence, no overpromising
- **Route when**: Need customer communication, demos, training materials, enablement content

### Ankylosaurus (Anky) — Validator

- **Role**: Quality assurance, compliance checking, verification, auditing
- **Disallowed**: Implementation, architecture decisions, remediation
- **Constraint**: May block progress; may identify violated requirements and missing evidence; may not design or implement remediation
- **Route when**: Need review, audit, compliance triage, security review, testing validation

### Parasaurolophus (Para) — Monitor

- **Role**: Observation, anomaly detection, health checking, drift detection
- **Disallowed**: Remediation, changes, implementation
- **Constraint**: Signals only; interpretation and response must be routed to another agent
- **Route when**: Need ongoing observation, monitoring setup, alerting configuration, drift detection

### Orchestrator (Orch) — Workflow Router

- **Role**: Routes tasks to appropriate agents, coordinates multi-step workflows
- **Disallowed**: Tool calls; file writes; code execution; bypassing convergence
- **Constraint**: Must have convergence brief before routing; must flag 🚨 ONE-WAY DOOR before agent assignment if decision is irreversible
- **Route when**: Multi-step workflows, agent coordination needed, complex task sequencing
- **Status**: DESIGN-ONLY PLACEHOLDER — The Orchestrator is not considered an implemented agent until explicitly promoted via decisions.md
- **Promotion**: Requires an explicit decisions.md entry marking the Orchestrator as implemented

---

## 6. Agent Communication Protocol (MCP-style, In-Session Only)

**Purpose**: Standardize agent-to-agent handoffs during a single session.

**Message structure**:

    {
      "from_agent": "ark_type:agent_name:version",
      "to_agent": "ark_type:agent_name:version",
      "message_type": "request | response | error",
      "trace_id": "unique_session_trace_id",
      "payload": {
        "task": "what needs to be done",
        "context": "relevant information",
        "artifacts": ["path1", "path2"],
        "constraints": ["constraint1", "constraint2"]
      },
      "metadata": {
        "timestamp": "ISO8601",
        "priority": "normal | high | critical"
      }
    }

**Rules**:

- Used for coordination, not logging
- Buffered in short-term memory only (cleared at session end)
- If something must persist, write it explicitly into artifacts or decisions.md

---

## 7. Short-Term Memory Policy

### During a single Kiro session:

- Agents MAY hold context in memory (e.g., search results, intermediate artifacts)
- MCP messages MAY be buffered for workflow coordination
- Memory MUST be cleared when session ends

### Across sessions:

- NO persistent memory of engagement details
- NO knowledge retention from previous projects
- Agent state (impressions, fail_gap) persists in decisions.md only

### Rationale:

- Prevents cross-contamination between projects
- Forces explicit knowledge capture (if it matters, document it)
- Keeps the system stateless and restartable
- One agent does one thing; if it works, we're good; if not, we improve it and move on

### Exception:

Agent maturity state (UNVALIDATED/WORKING/PRODUCTION) persists because it tracks reliability, not engagement-specific knowledge.

---

## 8. Explicit Non-Assumptions

Intentionally excluded:

- ❌ No persistent memory across engagements/projects
- ❌ No cross-project knowledge retention
- ❌ No autonomous "reasoning agent" tier that bypasses convergence
- ❌ No silent agent chaining without human visibility
- ❌ No system that supersedes human judgment

---

## 9. Promotion to Core

Promote an assumption into `palette-core.md` **only if**:

1. ✓ It consistently improves convergence
2. ✓ It reduces ambiguity or failure
3. ✓ It remains debuggable
4. ✓ It generalizes across domains
5. ✓ It introduces no hidden state
6. ✓ Human explicitly approves promotion
7. ✓ Promotion is recorded in decisions.md (toolkit-changing decision)

## KGDRS + KGE Tracking (EXPERIMENTAL / FORGETTABLE)

**Purpose**: During agent-building, track when we lacked enough context to be right.
This layer is disposable once agents are reliable.

### KGE ledger location (toolkit-only)
- Canonical path: `~/fde/kgdrs/kges.md`
- Append-only. Delete anytime once agents are working.

### When to record a KGE
Record a KGE only when the system emits **⚠️ KNOWLEDGE GAP DETECTED**.

### KGE entry format (append-only in kges.md)
---
### KGE: <YYYY-MM-DD> / <KGE-ID>
- **RIU involved**: <RIU-ID>
- **Decision at risk**: <what cannot be safely decided>
- **Signals observed**:
  - <free-text signal>
  - <free-text signal>
- **Retrieval plan (order)**:
  1) Internal/pasted docs needed: <what to request>
  2) Web query (if still blocked): <what to search>
- **What to bring back**: <artifact requirements>
- **Resolution**: <resolved | overridden | abandoned>
- **Notes**: <1-2 lines>

## 11. Reset Rule

At any time, this file may be:

- **Simplified**
- **Rewritten**
- **Deleted entirely**

**Recovery requirement**:

Palette must always be restartable from:

1. `palette-core.md`
2. Minimal artifacts + decisions.md
3. Zero historical memory

> **This file exists to learn, not to remember.**

## Quick Reference: Agent Lifecycle

    New Agent → Tier 1 (UNVALIDATED)
        ↓ (10 consecutive successes)
    Tier 2 (WORKING)
        ↓ (50 runs, <5% failure rate)
    Tier 3 (PRODUCTION)
        ↓ (2 failures within any 10 impressions (fail_gap ≤ 9))
    Tier 2 (WORKING) — refinement needed
        ↓ (failure while fail_gap ≤ 9)
    Tier 1 (UNVALIDATED) — back to validation

**Note**: Orchestrator agent follows same lifecycle but tracks workflow-level success (did it route correctly?) not task-level execution.
