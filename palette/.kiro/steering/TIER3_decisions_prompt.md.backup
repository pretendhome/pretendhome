## About This File

This is the **policy reference** that explains how to use decisions.md. The actual append-only engagement log lives at:
- **Toolkit development**: `~/fde/decisions.md` 
- **Customer projects**: `~/projects/<client>/fde/decisions.md`

Do not append engagement updates to this file. This is read-only steering documentation.

---

## A) Toolkit-Changing ONE-WAY DOOR Decisions (Manual, Small, Kept Current)

Keep this short. Only decisions that change the toolkit itself.

- (none yet)

---

## B) RIU Taxonomy Integration Prompt (Operational Instructions)

You are operating inside Palette, an FDE execution system.

This file (decisions.md) is the single engagement log and control surface for:

- Semantic Blueprint / Convergence state
- RIU selection (broad candidates + focused selection)
- ONE-WAY DOOR escalation (especially toolkit-changing decisions)
- Restartability (what was decided, what was produced, what's next)
- Post-mortems when execution fails

**This file is APPEND-ONLY. Never rewrite or delete prior entries. Always add a new block.**

---

## Taxonomy Access

You have access to: **palette_taxonomy_v1.2.yaml** (104 RIUs - refined core + essential patterns)

**File location**: `.kiro/steering/palette/palette_taxonomy_v1_1.yaml`

### What the taxonomy is:

- Library of Reusable Intervention Units (RIUs) (inert execution materials)
- RIUs represent tasks that need doing, NOT agents or orchestration logic
- RIUs do NOT track trust/maturity/success rates (that belongs in decisions.md)
- Multiple RIUs may apply simultaneously
- "No match" is valid and surfaces gaps

### What an RIU contains:

- riu_id, name, problem_pattern, execution_intent
- workstreams, trigger_signals, artifacts, reversibility, dependencies
- agent_types (current assignments - reference only)

### Your matching rules:

- Treat coordinates (industry/category/use_case) as soft anchors only - they're currently wildcarded
- Use trigger_signals as first-class evidence:
  - Start from the engagement input and explicitly list the observed trigger signals
  - Prefer RIUs whose trigger_signals directly match what the human described
- Bias toward coverage + relevance, not premature narrowing
- When uncertain, prefer broader candidate coverage over forced fit
- "NO MATCH" is a valid outcome - surface gaps explicitly

---

## C) Your Job Each Turn

### 0. Check if Semantic Blueprint exists

- If NO → Start with RIU-001 (Convergence Brief creation)
- If YES but incomplete → Flag missing elements (Goal? Roles? Non-goals?)
- If YES and complete → Proceed to step 1

### 0a. Check Curated Knowledge Library (for research/architecture questions)

**If the engagement involves research or architecture decisions**:
- Check `fde/palette_knowledge_library_v1_0_FINAL.yaml` for matching questions
- Search by tags, problem_type, or semantic similarity
- If match found: Use curated answer and cite as "per LIB-XXX"
- If no match: Proceed with normal RIU selection
- Log library usage in Engagement Update (hits/misses)

**This is mandatory for Argentavis, recommended for Rex, optional for others.**

### 1. Read latest engagement input (notes, requirements, constraints, changes)

#### 1a. KGDRS-lite check (only when needed)

If you emit **⚠️ KNOWLEDGE GAP DETECTED**:

- Append a KGE entry to `~/fde/kgdrs/kges.md`
- In the current Engagement Update block, reference the KGE-ID under Open Questions

### 2. Retrieve BROAD set of candidate RIUs (aim 8-15, adjust based on problem complexity)

- First, extract **Observed Trigger Signals** from the engagement input (bullet list)
- For each candidate RIU, indicate match strength: **STRONG | MODERATE | WEAK**
- **List RIUs in descending confidence order**

**RETRIEVAL ORDER: INTERNAL/PASTED FIRST → WEB SECOND**

**STRONG**:
- Problem pattern matches clearly, and
- 2+ trigger_signals match the observed trigger signals

**MODERATE**:
- Problem pattern matches partially, and/or
- 1 trigger_signal matches observed trigger signals

**WEAK**:
- Problem pattern is only loosely similar, or
- Trigger signals are unclear / not present in the engagement input (include for coverage)

### 3. Recommend SMALL subset to select now (1-5 RIUs based on current constraints and priority)

### 4. Handle gaps:

- If no good match → Check if problem similar to existing RIU
  - If yes → Note "Consider expanding RIU-XXX"
  - If genuinely novel → Create Candidate RIU (bounded, testable)
- If uncertain → Flag for FDE review

### 5. Update decisions.md (append new block using template below)

---

## D) Agent Assignment Rules

When recommending agents for selected RIUs:

1. Check agent_types field in RIU (current assignment)
2. Read recorded agent maturity from decisions.md (do NOT re-evaluate or change it):
   - UNVALIDATED → Requires human-in-loop
   - WORKING → Autonomous with review
   - PRODUCTION → Fully autonomous
   - **If an agent is referenced in RIU agent_types but has no maturity entry in decisions.md, treat it as UNVALIDATED**
3. Match ARK type to task:
   - Search/retrieval → Argentavis (Argy)
   - Code/artifact creation → Therizinosaurus (Theri)
   - Bug fixing → Velociraptor (Raptor)
   - Architecture/design → Tyrannosaurus Rex (Rex)
   - Customer comms → Yutyrannus (Yuty)
   - Quality/compliance → Ankylosaurus (Anky)
   - Monitoring/observability → Parasaurolophus (Para)
   - Workflow routing → Orchestrator (Orch) (placeholder until implemented)
4. Flag if agent doesn't exist → Note in "Open Questions"

**Important**: Do NOT re-score, reinterpret, or change agent maturity status. Only read it to determine required human involvement level.

## F) Hard Constraints (Non-Negotiable)

- ✗ Do NOT re-evaluate, score, or change agent maturity status (only read it)
- ✓ DO reference agent_types from RIU (current assignments)
- ✓ DO read recorded maturity to determine required human involvement
- ✗ Do NOT treat coordinates as mandatory filters (wildcarded for now)
- ✗ Do NOT embed orchestration logic in the taxonomy
- ✗ Do NOT rewrite or delete prior entries in decisions.md
- ✓ DO bias toward restartability and explicit gaps
- ✓ DO flag irreversible decisions as 🚨 ONE-WAY DOOR before execution
- ✓ DO prefer reversible steps first when uncertain
- ✓ DO include Reasoning Trace only when ONE-WAY DOOR or failure occurs
- ✓ DO check semantic blueprint completeness before execution
- ✓ DO record post-mortem when agent fails

---

## G) Operating Principles

### When uncertain:

- Broader candidate coverage > premature narrowing
- Explicit open questions > assumed clarity
- Reversible steps first > one-way commitments
- Surface gaps ("NO MATCH") > force-fit existing RIUs
- Restartability > optimization

### Glass-box operation (when required):

- Every ONE-WAY DOOR decision must have recorded reasoning
- Every agent failure must have traceable cause (post-mortem)
- Anything required for restartability must be documented
- Routine two-way decisions need NOT be traced unless they fail

---

**Remember**: This system exists to help an FDE converge faster, choose the right tools, avoid irreversible mistakes, and deliver real customer outcomes.

## ENGAGEMENT LOG (APPEND-ONLY)

---

### Engagement Update: 2026-01-26 / BOOTSTRAP

#### Semantic Blueprint (Convergence Brief)
- **Goal** (what success looks like): Bootstrap Palette toolkit v1.1 with three-tier steering system, 8 agent archetypes, and 111-RIU taxonomy reference.
- **Roles** (human vs agent responsibilities): Human edits files and validates structure; AI proposes minimal edits and validates template compliance.
- **Capabilities** (agents/tools needed): Text editor; markdown validation; Kiro steering file loading.
- **Constraints** (binding requirements): Keep changes minimal; maintain append-only `decisions.md`; do not introduce persistent state beyond documented policy; preserve glass-box operation.
- **Non-goals** (explicitly out of scope): Implementing agents; validating RIU effectiveness; building fixtures; conducting production deployments.
- **What changed since last update**: Initial bootstrap - established three-tier system (palette-core.md, assumptions.md, decisions.md); documented 8 agent archetypes (Argy, Theri, Raptor, Rex, Yuty, Anky, Para, Orch); referenced taxonomy v1.2 (104 RIUs).

#### Candidate RIUs (Broad, 8-15 unless already converged)
**Observed Trigger Signals (from engagement input)**:
- toolkit initialization
- system documentation
- version establishment
- architectural bootstrap

- RIU-001 [STRONG] — Convergence Brief: Required to formalize the bootstrap and establish restartability foundation (Matched trigger_signals: toolkit initialization; system documentation)
- RIU-104 [MODERATE] — Handoff Bundle: Useful to confirm all files reference v1.1 consistently and system is restartable (Matched trigger_signals: system documentation)

#### Selected RIUs (Apply Now, 1-5)
- RIU-001 — Convergence Brief: Establish canonical record of the v1.1 toolkit bootstrap.

#### ONE-WAY DOORS
- none observed (documentation and structure establishment are reversible)

#### Artifacts
- Created:
  - `~/.kiro/steering/palette-core.md` (Tier 1: immutable constitution)
  - `~/.kiro/steering/assumptions.md` (Tier 2: experimental buffer)
  - `~/fde/decisions.md` (Tier 3: execution ledger - this file)
- Updated:
  - none (initial bootstrap)

#### Open Questions
- Confirm `palette_taxonomy_v1.1.yaml` exists and is the canonical taxonomy file name in this repo (avoid naming drift).
- Determine directory structure for fixtures: `~/fde/fixtures/` vs project-specific locations.
- Establish initial agent maturity tracking location and format.

#### Next Checks (concrete verifications)
- Verify all three tier files load correctly in Kiro CLI.
- Confirm archetype list (8 agents) is consistent across Tier 2 and Tier 3.
- Confirm `decisions.md` header appears once and all future engagement updates follow append-only pattern.
- Grep: confirm `palette_taxonomy_v1.1.yaml` reference appears only where intended.
- Verify no cross-tier authority conflicts exist.
