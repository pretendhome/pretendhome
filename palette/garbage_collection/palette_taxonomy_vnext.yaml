principles:
- RIUs are inert execution materials; they do not route, orchestrate, or track usage.
- Coordinates are soft anchors (search/narrowing aids), not constraints.
- 'Reversibility is explicit: two_way | one_way | mixed.'
- Agents are referenced by type only; behavior lives in Assumptions layer.
- Multiple RIUs may apply; 'no match' is valid and surfaces gaps.
