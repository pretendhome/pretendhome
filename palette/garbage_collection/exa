Exa is tackling one of the most important problems in AI: finding and serving high-quality knowledge at scale. What excites me most is not just the infrastructure or embeddings, but the chance to work directly with customers to translate messy, real-world needs into systems that actually ship and create value. The Forward Deployed Engineer role aligns with how I work best—bridging customers, GTM, and engineering, owning outcomes end-to-end, and learning directly from what happens in the field.


I designed and operated an end-to-end agentic enablement system that changed how GTM teams accessed and generated content in real time. The system grounded LLM outputs using structured knowledge, retrieval pipelines, and governance controls, allowing sales teams to generate context-aware pitches, plays, and explanations at the moment of need. I’m proud of this work not because it was technically novel, but because it worked under real constraints, adapted as requirements shifted, and was shaped directly by feedback from sales, product, and customers.

I’m motivated by solving real problems with people. I enjoy walking into ambiguous situations, figuring out what actually matters, and building systems that help teams move faster and make better decisions. I’m especially energized by working directly with customers, learning from what breaks, and iterating quickly in response. Owning outcomes end-to-end—rather than just shipping code or specs—is what keeps me engaged and continuously improving.
