  question: What frameworks should I use for business model design?
  answer: |
    Use these proven frameworks for business model design:
    
    **1. Business Model Canvas** (Osterwalder)
    - 9 building blocks: Value proposition, customer segments, channels, 
      customer relationships, revenue streams, key resources, key activities, 
      key partnerships, cost structure
    - Best for: Startups and new ventures
    - Time: 1-2 hours to complete
    - Output: One-page visual business model
    
    **2. Value Proposition Canvas** (Osterwalder)
    - Customer profile: Jobs to be done, pains, gains
    - Value map: Products/services, pain relievers, gain creators
    - Best for: Product-market fit validation
    - Time: 30-60 min to complete
    - Output: Customer-value alignment map
    
    **3. Lean Canvas** (Maurya)
    - Focuses on: Problem, solution, key metrics, unfair advantage, channels
    - Best for: Lean startups and MVPs
    - Time: 20-30 min to complete
    - Output: One-page lean business model
    
    **4. Strategic Framework** (Porter's 5 Forces + SWOT)
    - Porter's 5 Forces: Supplier power, buyer power, competitive rivalry, 
      threat of substitutes, threat of new entrants
    - SWOT: Strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats
    - Best for: Established businesses and competitive strategy
    - Time: 2-3 hours to complete
    - Output: Competitive positioning analysis
    
    **When to use which**:
    - New startup → Lean Canvas or Business Model Canvas
    - Product validation → Value Proposition Canvas
    - Strategic planning → Porter's 5 Forces + SWOT
    - Comprehensive plan → Combine multiple frameworks
    
    **Rossi Mission example**:
    - Used Business Model Canvas for revenue streams (7 streams)
    - Used Value Proposition Canvas for artist value (50/50 split)
    - Used SWOT for competitive positioning (scarcity economics)

  question: How do I conduct market research for a business plan?
  answer: |
    Comprehensive market research process for business plans:
    
    **1. Market Sizing (TAM/SAM/SOM)**
    - TAM (Total Addressable Market): Total market demand if you had 100% share
    - SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market): Segment you can realistically reach
    - SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market): What you can capture in 3-5 years
    - Growth rates: Historical (3-5 years) and projected (3-5 years)
    
    **2. Customer Research**
    - Customer segments: Demographics, psychographics, behavior
    - Pain points and needs: What problems do they have?
    - Buying behavior: How do they make decisions?
    - Willingness to pay: What's their budget?
    - Decision criteria: What matters most?
    
    **3. Competitive Analysis**
    - Direct competitors: Same solution, same market
    - Indirect competitors: Different solution, same need
    - Substitute products: Alternative ways to solve problem
    - Competitive positioning map: Price vs quality, features vs simplicity
    - Market share: Who dominates? Who's growing?
    
    **4. Industry Analysis (Porter's 5 Forces)**
    - Supplier power: How much leverage do suppliers have?
    - Buyer power: How much leverage do customers have?
    - Competitive rivalry: How intense is competition?
    - Threat of substitutes: How easy to switch to alternatives?
    - Threat of new entrants: How easy for new competitors to enter?
    
    **Data Sources**:
    - Primary: Customer interviews (10-20), surveys (100+), focus groups (6-10)
    - Secondary: Industry reports (IBISWorld, Gartner), government data (Census, BLS)
    - Competitive: Competitor websites, reviews (G2, Capterra), job postings (LinkedIn)
    - Financial: Form 990 (nonprofits), SEC filings (public companies), Crunchbase (startups)
    
    **Time Budget**:
    - Quick (2-4 hours): Secondary research only, basic sizing
    - Medium (8-12 hours): Secondary + limited primary (5-10 interviews)
    - Comprehensive (20+ hours): Full primary + secondary, detailed analysis
    
    **Rossi Mission example**:
    - TAM: SF Bay Area graffiti/street art market
    - SAM: Valencia Street corridor (2-4% vacancy, healthy)
    - SOM: 80 artists, $780K Year 1 revenue
    - Comparable: Creative Growth ($3.26M, 140 artists, 50 years)
    - Competitive: Stüssy Tribe, ALIFE, GX1000 (rejected as weak analogies)
