  name: Business Plan Creation
  problem_pattern: Customer needs comprehensive business plan but lacks time/expertise to research comparables, model financials, and structure narrative
  execution_intent: |
    End-to-end business plan creation through 8-phase process:
    1. Discovery: Customer interview → convergence brief
    2. Comparable Research: Find 2-3 organizations with financial data
    3. Market Research: Size, trends, segments, competition
    4. Strategic Framework: Revenue model, org structure, financials
    5. Product Strategy: Offerings, pricing, go-to-market
    6. Document Assembly: Executive summary, plan, appendix
    7. Quality Validation: Score 75+, gap identification
    8. Customer Review: Feedback, iteration, approval
    
    Validated with Rossi Mission (Feb 2026) - "very well received"

  name: Comparable Organization Research
  problem_pattern: Customer claims "no one does this" or uses weak analogies; need credible comparables with financial data to validate business model
  execution_intent: |
    Find and analyze comparable organizations:
    1. Search for 2-3 organizations solving same problem at scale
    2. Extract financial data (Form 990, public filings, reports)
    3. Benchmark key metrics (revenue, costs, model, growth)
    4. Validate customer's model against comparables (or identify gaps)
    
    Breakthrough example: Creative Growth Art Center (Rossi Mission)
    - Form 990: $3.26M revenue, 140 artists, 50/50 split, 50 years
    - Proved nonprofit artist collective model works at scale
    - Replaced weak analogies (Supreme, Stüssy) with credible comparable

  success_conditions:
    execution: |
      - Find 1-3 credible comparables
      - Extract financial data (revenue, costs, model)
      - Benchmark key metrics
    outcome: |
      - Validate customer's model (or identify gaps)
      - Provide financial benchmarks for projections
      - Build credibility with stakeholders
    safety_quality: |
      - Comparables must be credible (not weak analogies)
      - Financial data must be sourced (Form 990, public filings)
      - Benchmarks must be relevant (same industry, stage, model)
  
  failure_modes:
    silent:
      - Weak comparables (not credible)
      - Missing financial data (can't benchmark)
    loud:
      - No comparables found (novel business model)
      - Comparables invalidate customer's model

    Search strategy:
    - Start with customer's description
    - Search for "[industry] + [model] + [scale]"
    - Look for organizations 2-5 years ahead
    - Prioritize geographic/cultural similarity

  name: Financial Crisis Detection
  problem_pattern: Customer has revenue projections but hasn't modeled cash flow; crises hidden in spreadsheet (e.g., Month 17 crisis in Rossi)
  execution_intent: |
    Analyze cash flow to identify future crises:
    1. Build 3-year cash flow model (monthly Year 1, quarterly Year 2-3)
    2. Identify months with negative cash (crises)
    3. Calculate reserve buffer needed (3-month minimum)
    4. Recommend funding ask increase (if needed)
    
    Rossi example: Month 17 crisis detected
    - Cash flow modeling showed negative cash in Month 17
    - Led to funding ask increase ($150K → $185-200K)
    - 3-month reserve buffer added

  success_conditions:
    execution: |
      - Monthly cash flow for Year 1
      - Identify all negative cash months
      - Calculate reserve buffer (3-month minimum)
    outcome: |
      - Prevent cash crises (early warning)
      - Right-size funding ask (adequate runway)
      - Build stakeholder confidence (rigor)
    safety_quality: |
      - Must model monthly (not quarterly) for Year 1
      - Must include all costs (fixed + variable)
      - Must flag all negative months as crises
  
  failure_modes:
    silent:
      - Quarterly modeling (misses monthly crises)
      - Missing costs (underestimates burn)
    loud:
      - Multiple crises identified (business not viable)

  notes: |
    Time budget: 1 hour
    
    Modeling approach:
    - Start with revenue projections (by stream)
    - Add all costs (fixed: rent, salaries; variable: COGS, marketing)
    - Calculate monthly net cash flow
    - Identify negative months (crises)
    - Add 3-month reserve buffer to funding ask
    
    Common crises:
    - Month 1-3: Pre-revenue burn
    - Month 6-9: Scaling costs before revenue scales
    - Month 12-18: Growth investment before payback
