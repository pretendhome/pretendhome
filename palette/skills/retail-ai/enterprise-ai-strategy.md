# Enterprise AI Strategy for Retail

Validated patterns from Gap Inc. AI Strategy engagement.

## FDE Model Positioning

**When to use**: Multi-brand retail, existing infrastructure, need rapid iteration
**Not**: Building platforms from scratch, single-brand with centralized ops

**Key talking points**:
- 35-40% cheaper than platform model
- Weeks to value (not months)
- Embed with business units (stores, merchandising, supply chain)
- Proven: Palantir, Databricks, Accenture (30K FDEs), Infosys (4,600+ projects)

## Three-Bucket ROI Framework

**Bucket 1: Cost Reduction** (40% weight)
- Inventory waste, markdown waste, labor reallocation
- Example: Walmart 30% logistics savings, Zara 85% sell-through

**Bucket 2: Productivity Gains** (35% weight)
- Time freed for higher-value work, faster decisions, error reduction
- Example: Perry Ellis 95% SKU launch time reduction

**Bucket 3: Cost Avoidance** (25% weight)
- Employee turnover, stockouts, brand safety incidents prevented
- Example: Stitch Fix 30% return reduction

**CFO Narrative**: "We invested $X and reduced costs by $Y → request less for Year 2 because we built one system, not 100 tools"

## Operations-First Sequencing

**Year 1**: Internal-facing (inventory, pricing, employee tools)
**Year 2**: Scale + corporate functions
**Year 3**: Customer-facing (after operations proven)

**Rationale**: Lower brand safety risk, clear ROI, builds confidence
**Avoid**: Amazon Just Walk Out (pure automation), Taco Bell Voice AI (customer-facing too early)

## LVMH Maison Autonomy Pattern

**For**: Multi-brand enterprises (4+ brands with distinct identities)
**Structure**: Central platform + federated use cases
**Example**: LVMH 75 maisons, 40K employees, 2M+ monthly AI requests

**Decision Rights**:
- Platform: Central (Office of AI)
- Use cases: Federated (brand leaders)
- Risk/compliance: Central enables, brands execute

## Behavior Change Over Training

**Not**: "Here's how to use this tool" (training)
**Instead**: "Here's how this makes YOUR job easier" (behavior change)

**Tactics**:
- 5-minute recipes (live workflows, not 30-min training)
- Champions program (peer adoption, not top-down)
- Dashboard use as KPI (LVMH pattern: non-adoption halts initiatives)

**Metrics**: Time-to-decision improvement, confidence scores (not just login counts)

## Common CFO Objections

**"Why not buy best-of-breed tools?"**
→ Tool sprawl: $2M-$5M/year, 100 integrations, fragmented knowledge

**"What if ROI doesn't materialize?"**
→ Phased investment, kill criteria (12 weeks), conservative estimates (50% of projected)

**"How do I know this will work?"**
→ Retail comparables (Walmart, Zara, LVMH), payback <1 month (Year 1 pilots)

## Retail AI Failure Patterns

**Amazon Just Walk Out**: Required 1,000 manual verifiers (tracking failures)
**Taco Bell Voice AI**: Accents, edge cases, viral failures
**Supermarket AI**: Generated dangerous recipes (inadequate safety filters)
**95% GenAI pilots fail**: Data fragmentation, no unified foundation

**Mitigation**: Operations-first, human-in-loop, A/B testing, brand safety guardrails
