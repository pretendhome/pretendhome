name: Product Decision Lens
optional: true

critical_question:
  as_palette: "How will this lens best help me, and what would it actually help me do?"
  answer: "It helps Palette convert route outputs into explicit product decisions with evidence, reversibility labels, owners, and success metrics. It reduces 'analysis without decision' and improves go/no-go quality."

when_to_use:
  signals:
    - roadmap
    - prioritization
    - launch readiness
    - go/no-go
    - scope negotiation
  not_for:
    - deep debugging root-cause analysis
    - low-level implementation tasks

  supporting_agents:
    - argentavis
    - therizinosaurus
  library_links:
    - "Use LIB entries tied to decision frameworks, risk framing, and launch operations."
  company_matrix_use:
    - "Use company examples only to validate market reality, not to copy strategy blindly."

  required_sections:
    - Decision
    - Why now
    - Evidence
    - One-way vs two-way door classification
    - Risks and mitigations
    - Owner and due date
    - Success metric
  forbidden_patterns:
    - unsupported certainty
    - ownerless recommendations
    - no metric/no deadline action lists

quality_checks:
  - "Decision is explicit (not implied)."
  - "At least one measurable success metric is present."
  - "Reversibility is labeled."
  - "Top risk has mitigation and owner."

evaluation_plan:

    - artifact_rework_rate
    - gate_decision_time
    - owd_false_positive_rate

  kill_if:
    - "No improvement on at least 2 of 4 metrics."
    - "Process overhead increases >20% with no quality gain."
