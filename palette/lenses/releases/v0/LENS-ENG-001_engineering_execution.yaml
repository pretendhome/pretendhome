name: Engineering Execution Lens
optional: true

critical_question:
  as_palette: "How will this lens best help me, and what would it actually help me do?"
  answer: "It helps Palette turn good plans into executable engineering slices with clear constraints, test expectations, rollback paths, and dependency sequencing. It reduces vague implementation handoffs."

when_to_use:
  signals:
    - implementation planning
    - integration sequencing
    - technical risk containment
    - release readiness
    - incident follow-through
  not_for:
    - executive narrative crafting
    - non-technical stakeholder positioning

  primary_rius:
    - RIU-062
    - RIU-073
    - RIU-001
  supporting_rius:
    - RIU-014
  primary_agents:
    - therizinosaurus
    - velociraptor
    - rex
  supporting_agents:
    - ankylosaurus
    - parasaurolophus
    - argentavis
  library_links:
    - "Use LIB entries tied to reliability, failure handling, integration, and operational runbooks."
  company_matrix_use:
    - "Use company mappings to estimate implementation patterns and delivery risk, not as architecture authority."

output_contract:
  required_sections:
    - Scope boundary
    - Task slices (ordered)
    - Dependencies and blockers
    - Test/validation plan
    - Rollback or recovery path
    - Operational checks
  forbidden_patterns:
    - architecture drift during build
    - untestable acceptance criteria
    - no rollback for risky changes

quality_checks:
  - "Each slice is independently verifiable."
  - "Dependencies are explicit and ordered."
  - "Validation checks are executable, not narrative."
  - "Risky steps include rollback or containment."

evaluation_plan:
  compare_against_no_lens:
    - implementation_rework_rate
    - defect_escape_rate
    - time_to_first_valid_artifact
    - rollback_readiness_score
  minimum_sample_size: 20
  kill_if:
    - "No measurable gain in implementation quality metrics."
    - "Adds planning complexity without reducing downstream defects."
