name: Developer Delivery Lens
optional: true

critical_question:
  as_palette: "How will this lens best help me, and what would it actually help me do?"
  answer: "It helps Palette produce developer-ready implementation outputs: scoped code tasks, concrete acceptance checks, test-first expectations, and debugging-ready handoffs. It reduces ambiguity between architecture intent and code execution."

when_to_use:
  signals:
    - code implementation request
    - refactor planning
    - test plan definition
    - bug-to-fix workflow
    - release hardening
  not_for:
    - executive narrative framing
    - non-technical stakeholder communication

  primary_rius:
    - RIU-062
    - RIU-073
    - RIU-001
  supporting_rius:
    - RIU-014
  primary_agents:
    - therizinosaurus
    - velociraptor
    - ankylosaurus
  supporting_agents:
    - rex
    - parasaurolophus
    - argentavis
  library_links:
    - "Prefer LIB entries covering implementation patterns, validation, reliability, and rollback-safe changes."
  company_matrix_use:
    - "Use company matrix signals to inform practical stack constraints, not to force specific tooling choices."

output_contract:
  required_sections:
    - Implementation scope boundary
    - Ordered code tasks
    - Acceptance checks (verifiable)
    - Test plan (unit/integration/e2e as applicable)
    - Risk and rollback notes
    - Handoff notes for debugging/monitoring
  forbidden_patterns:
    - vague implementation steps
    - no test strategy
    - architecture changes hidden inside build tasks
    - irreversible changes without gate callout

quality_checks:
  - "Tasks are small enough to execute independently."
  - "Each task has a clear done condition."
  - "At least one explicit validation command/check is present."
  - "Risky tasks include rollback or containment strategy."
  - "Debug context is preserved for downstream Raptor/Para use."

evaluation_plan:
  compare_against_no_lens:
    - implementation_rework_rate
    - test_pass_rate_on_first_run
    - bug_reopen_rate
    - time_to_first_mergeable_artifact
  minimum_sample_size: 20
  kill_if:
    - "No measurable improvement in at least 2 of 4 metrics."
    - "Increases implementation latency >20% without quality gain."
    - "Creates higher defect reopen rate than baseline."
