# Claudia Job Search - Palette Workflow

**Goal**: Discover unexpected high-fit roles through iterative search + game theory ranking

**Problem**: Traditional keyword search misses roles Claudia is qualified for but wouldn't think to search

**Solution**: Multi-phase discovery → game theory ranking → validation

---

## Phase 1: YUTY - Search Strategy Design

**Task**: Design iterative search strategy that discovers unexpected matches

**Output**: 
- Keyword clusters (not just "admissions")
- Search expansion strategy
- Discovery criteria (what makes a "hidden gem" role)

---

## Phase 2: ARGY - Iterative Search

**Task**: Execute searches, use gradient descent to optimize

**Approach**:
1. Start with obvious keywords
2. Analyze results for patterns
3. Pivot to adjacent keywords
4. Discover roles Claudia wouldn't search for independently

**Output**: 50-100 roles across broad range

## Phase 3: REX - Game Theory Ranking

**Task**: Pit roles against each other, score by fit

**Approach**:
- Pairwise comparison (Role A vs Role B)
- Scoring dimensions: skills match, growth potential, comp, culture, commute
- Elo-style ranking system
- Output: Ranked list with confidence scores

## Phase 4: THERI - Build Application Materials

**Task**: Generate customized materials for top 10

---

## Phase 5: ANKY - Validate

**Task**: Stress test rankings, identify false positives

---

**Status**: Ready for Yuty to design search strategy
