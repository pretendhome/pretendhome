## DECISION TREE

**IF** Track 1 yields offer (Fusion or YMCA):
- **Accept** if comp >$100K AND role has growth path
- **Negotiate** for title upgrade or expanded scope
- **Use** as bridge while continuing Track 2

**IF** Track 2 yields conversations (school leaders):
- **Ask** about summer 2026 hiring plans
- **Position** for "when you're ready to hire"
- **Stay** top-of-mind through follow-ups

**IF** Track 3 yields EdTech opportunities:
- **Evaluate** against schools (EdTech may pay more but less mission-driven)
- **Consider** as pivot if schools don't materialize

---

## TIMELINE

**Weeks 1-2**: Apply to Track 1 (Fusion, YMCA) + Research Track 2 (20 schools)
**Weeks 3-4**: Outreach to Track 2 (5 schools/week)
**Weeks 5-6**: Coffee chats + Expand to Track 3 (EdTech)
**Weeks 7-8**: Follow-ups + Evaluate offers

---

## RISK ASSESSMENT

**Primary Risk**: Thin market means low volume of opportunities
- **Mitigation**: Proactive outreach to 20 schools BEFORE they post

**Secondary Risk**: Schools may not hire until fall 2026
- **Mitigation**: Position for "summer or fall 2026", stay engaged

**Tertiary Risk**: Bridge roles (Fusion, YMCA) may not align with long-term goals
- **Mitigation**: Negotiate for scope expansion, use as stepping stone

---

## ONE-WAY DOOR DECISIONS

🚨 **IF** offered Head of School role (Fusion): This is a BIG title jump
- **Risk**: May be over-leveled, high pressure, different context
- **Decision**: Only accept if comp >$120K AND clear support structure

🚨 **IF** pivoting to EdTech: This is a CAREER PIVOT away from schools
- **Risk**: May be hard to return to schools later
- **Decision**: Only pivot if comp >$130K AND role is education-focused (not pure tech)

---

**NEXT**: Argy executes Track 2 research (20 school profiles) + Track 3 search (EdTech roles)

**VALIDATION**: After research, Anky validates strategy and ranks opportunities using game theory
