| Education Leadership | 4 roles | 0 roles (1 temp pastoral care) |
| Salary Range | $70K-$270K | Unknown (no data) |

## STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATION

**OPTION A: FOCUS ON BAY AREA (RECOMMENDED)**
- 22 roles found, 5 with 75-82% interview probability
- Higher salaries ($100K-$150K range)
- Immediate opportunities (apply this week)
- **Timeline**: Interviews in 2-3 weeks, offers in 4-6 weeks

- Target 9 international schools (Milan, Paris, Geneva, Zurich)
- Outreach for summer 2026 or fall 2026 hiring
- **Timeline**: 3-6 months (schools hire slowly)
