## SEARCH EXPANSION STRATEGY

**Round 1: Obvious Keywords** (Baseline)
- Search Clusters 1-2
- Expected: 10-20 roles
- Goal: Establish baseline fit criteria

**Round 2: Adjacent Keywords** (Pivot)
- Search Clusters 3-5
- Expected: 30-50 roles
- Goal: Discover roles she wouldn't search for

**Round 3: Unexpected Keywords** (Discovery)
- Search Clusters 6-7
- Expected: 20-40 roles
- Goal: Find "hidden gem" roles

**Round 4: Gradient Descent** (Optimize)
- Analyze which keywords yielded highest fit
- Generate new keyword combinations
- Search again with optimized terms

---

## DISCOVERY CRITERIA (What Makes a "Hidden Gem")

**Must Have**:
1. Family-facing OR community-building component
2. Cross-functional coordination (not siloed)
3. Systems/process improvement opportunity
4. Mission-driven organization

**Bonus Points**:
5. International/multilingual valued
6. IB or progressive education context
7. Growth/expansion phase (not maintenance)
8. Hybrid role (not pure admissions, not pure ops)

**Red Flags**:
- Heavy fundraising (>50% of role)
- Pure finance/accounting
- 10+ direct reports required
- No family/community touchpoint

## SEARCH EXECUTION PLAN

**Platform Strategy**:
- LinkedIn: Clusters 1, 2, 6, 7 (corporate-style titles)
- Indeed: Clusters 3, 4, 5 (education-specific)
- EdJoin: Clusters 3, 4 (public/charter schools)
- NAIS/CAIS: Clusters 1, 2, 5 (independent schools)
- Glassdoor: Clusters 6, 7 (growth-stage orgs)

**Geographic Expansion**:
- Primary: SF, Oakland, Berkeley, Marin
- Secondary: Peninsula (Palo Alto, San Mateo)
- Tertiary: South Bay (San Jose) if remote option

**Iterative Refinement**:
1. Run Round 1 → Analyze top 5 fits → Extract common keywords
2. Run Round 2 → Identify unexpected matches → Pivot keywords
3. Run Round 3 → Discover hidden gems → Validate patterns
4. Run Round 4 → Optimize based on learnings → Final search

---

## SUCCESS METRICS

**Quantity**: 50-100 roles discovered (not 15)
**Quality**: 20+ roles with 80+ fit score
**Discovery**: 10+ roles Claudia wouldn't have searched for
**Diversity**: Roles span 5+ of the 7 clusters

---

## PROMPT FOR ARGY

"Execute iterative job search for Claudia using 7 keyword clusters. Start with obvious (Clusters 1-2), pivot to adjacent (Clusters 3-5), discover unexpected (Clusters 6-7). Use Perplexity to search LinkedIn, Indeed, EdJoin, NAIS, Glassdoor. For each round, analyze which keywords yield highest fit, then generate new combinations. Goal: 50-100 roles, 20+ with 80+ fit, 10+ unexpected discoveries. Bay Area focus (SF, Oakland, Marin, Peninsula). Report results by cluster with fit reasoning."

---

**NEXT**: Argy executes iterative search with gradient descent optimization

**VALIDATION CRITERIA**: 
- Did we find roles Claudia wouldn't search for? (YES/NO)
- Do top roles span multiple clusters? (YES/NO)
- Are there 10+ roles with 85+ fit? (YES/NO)

If NO to any → Iterate with new keyword combinations
