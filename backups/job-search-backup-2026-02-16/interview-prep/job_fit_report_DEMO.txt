🏗️  Analyzing top roles and creating action plan...

**STRATEGY (Next 30 Days)**

1. **Apply immediately (This Week)**
   - Anthropic FDE (96 fit) - HIGHEST PRIORITY. Apply today. Mention Palette Framework in cover letter as proof of agentic systems expertise.
   - Databricks Staff TPM (93 fit) - Direct title match. Apply by Friday. Emphasize AWS platform experience.
   - OpenAI Solutions Architect (94 fit) - Apply by Monday. Lead with knowledge architecture + multilingual advantage.

2. **Skill gap to address (Week 2-3)**
   - **Production deployment case studies**: Document 3 AWS customer deployments with metrics (users, accuracy, cost savings). Create a "deployment portfolio" PDF showing before/after impact. This addresses the "only 11 months in FDE role" concern.
   - **Platform engineering depth**: Brush up on distributed systems concepts (Spark, Delta Lake, MLOps pipelines). Take Databricks Academy free courses (8 hours). This prepares you for Databricks technical interviews.

3. **Network move (Week 2-4)**
   - **Anthropic employees**: Search LinkedIn for "Anthropic Forward Deployed Engineer" (12 results). Send personalized messages to 3 people. Mention Palette Framework + ask about deployment challenges. Target: 2 coffee chats before applying.
   - **AI enablement community**: Join "AI Enablement Practitioners" Slack (1,200 members). Post about Palette Framework. Build visibility in the space.
   - **Recruiter outreach**: Message Andrew Sell (FriendliAI recruiter you're already talking to). Ask if he knows anyone at Anthropic/OpenAI. Leverage warm intro.

**LEARNING PATH (Priority Order)**

- **Deployment storytelling (Week 1)**: 
  - Why needed: Interviewers will ask "Tell me about a time you deployed AI at scale." You need 3 STAR-format stories ready.
  - How to learn: Document AWS deployments. Format: Situation (customer problem), Task (your role), Action (what you built), Result (metrics). Practice telling each story in 2 minutes. Record yourself, refine until crisp.
  - Time investment: 4 hours (1 hour per story + 1 hour practice)

- **Platform engineering concepts (Week 2)**:
  - Why needed: Databricks technical bar is high. Expect whiteboard questions on distributed systems, data pipelines, model deployment.
  - How to learn: Databricks Academy free courses ("Lakehouse Fundamentals", "MLOps on Databricks"). Read Databricks blog (5 recent posts on AI platform). Understand Delta Lake, Unity Catalog, MLflow.
  - Time investment: 8 hours (courses + reading)

- **Company-specific AI positioning (Week 3)**:
  - Why needed: Each company has unique AI narrative. Anthropic = safety + enterprise deployment. OpenAI = frontier models + API platform. Databricks = unified data + AI platform. You need to speak their language.
  - How to learn: Read each company's blog (3 recent posts). Watch CEO talks on YouTube (Dario Amodei for Anthropic, Sam Altman for OpenAI, Ali Ghodsi for Databricks). Understand their positioning, tailor your pitch.
  - Time investment: 6 hours (2 hours per company)

**APPLICATION PRIORITY**

**Tier 1 (Apply this week - Feb 11-15)**
- Anthropic FDE (96 fit, 4 days old, 127 applicants) - APPLY TODAY
- Databricks Staff TPM (93 fit, 2 days old, 89 applicants) - APPLY FRIDAY
- OpenAI Solutions Architect (94 fit, 1 week old, 203 applicants) - APPLY MONDAY

**Tier 2 (Apply next week - Feb 18-22)**
- Scale AI Principal SE (91 fit, 5 days old, 156 applicants)
- Cohere AI Enablement Lead (89 fit, 1 week old, 78 applicants)

**Tier 3 (Monitor, apply if interested)**
- Palantir FDE (85 fit, but DC location + security clearance)
- Glean AI Outcomes Manager (84 fit, but more CS than technical)

**RISK ASSESSMENT**

- **Primary risk**: "Only 11 months in customer-facing AI deployment role" - Interviewers may question depth of FDE experience. 
  - **Mitigation**: Lead with Palette Framework as proof of hands-on building. Frame AWS TPM work as "deployment enablement at scale" (not just program management). Emphasize 11+ years at Amazon (credibility signal). Document 3 customer deployment case studies with metrics.

- **Secondary risk**: Compensation expectations ($200K+ total comp) may be at top of band for some roles.
  - **Mitigation**: Lead with value (agentic AI expertise is rare, multilingual skills are differentiator). Negotiate equity if base is lower. Anthropic/OpenAI/Databricks can all hit $250K+ total comp at senior IC level.

- **Tertiary risk**: Competition is fierce (89-203 applicants per role in first week).
  - **Mitigation**: Apply FAST (within 48 hours of posting). Use network for warm intros (Andrew Sell, Anthropic employees). Differentiate with Palette Framework (proof of hands-on capability, not just resume claims).

**DECISION POINTS**

🚨 **ONE-WAY DOOR**: If you get multiple offers, prioritize in this order:
1. Anthropic (mission + technical depth + compensation)
2. OpenAI (brand + compensation + growth)
3. Databricks (platform experience + compensation)
4. Scale AI (knowledge architecture fit, but commission risk)
5. Cohere (ownership + impact, but lower compensation ceiling)

🔄 **TWO-WAY DOOR**: You can apply to all 5 simultaneously. No downside to parallel applications.
