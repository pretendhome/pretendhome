  Phase 0: Alignment Before Execution
======================================================================

**Date**: February 12, 2026
**Project**: Gap Inc. AI Strategy & Enterprise Enablement
**Role**: Sr. Manager, AI Strategy & Enterprise Enablement — Office of AI
**Operator**: Mical Neill via Palette

## WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE (YEAR 1)

**Mical Neill in 12 months is:**

The **human voice** associated with AI transformation at Gap — the person who makes people comfortable, not afraid.

**Specifically:**

1. **The Enabler, Not the Executor**
   - High-impact pilots exist, but they came FROM the people who understand the business
   - Mical helped them understand how AI can help, then built what works for them together
   - Brand executives can prevent brand safety disasters themselves — Mical enabled them, didn't do it for them

2. **The Person Who Killed Bad Ideas**
   - Stopped any AI initiative with the pretense of "AI doing your work for you"
   - Prevented tool sprawl — no 100 AI tools, one agentic interface (Palette-style)
   - Said "no" to vendor hype and executive pressure when it didn't serve employees

3. **The Person Who Made AI Feel Like Amplification**
   - Store associates spend more time with customers because AI handles the rest
   - Store managers understand their direct reports better, position goods with more confidence, manage inventory with transparency
   - Employees feel more valued as individuals BECAUSE they're using AI — their work is faster, more complete, better, so they deliver with confidence

4. **The Person Who Shrunk the Budget**
   - ROI proven not by doubling budget, but by shrinking it
   - Did things the right way: one agentic system that auto-improves, not 100 tools that require maintenance

**The North Star:**
Every individual employee knows how to best use AI for them, in the way that best suits them to do their job.

---

## WHAT THIS PLAN MUST PROVE

**To the Gap hiring team:**

1. **Mical can translate Palette's agentic architecture to enterprise scale**
   - Not just indie projects — 10,000+ employees across 4 brands, corporate + DCs + stores

2. **Mical understands how AI should be used correctly by anyone**
   - Not claiming retail expertise he doesn't have
   - Claiming AI enablement methodology that works across domains
   - Will take the time to speak to store managers, merchandisers, and anyone else to understand their needs

3. **Mical can position AI as human amplification in a way that changes behavior**
   - Not just policy, not just training — actual behavior change
   - Proven at AWS: +17% attendance, +50% high-CSAT sessions, +67% sales plays covered

4. **Mical can say "no" to tool sprawl and vendor hype with a clear alternative**
   - One agentic interface, not 100 tools
   - Built on core capabilities: research, architecture, building, validation, monitoring
   - Auto-improves, serves multiple personas

**To Mical himself:**

That the operational execution gap (business/financial framing, risk/governance, operating model) can be closed through research and frameworks — and that his builder + enabler strengths are the differentiator, not the gap.

## THE RETAIL EXPERIENCE GAP (POSITIONING)

**The Framing:**

"My methodology is domain-agnostic because it starts with people, not processes. At AWS, I enabled sellers across 50+ GEOs and sales motions by understanding their incentives, constraints, and workflows — then building AI systems that amplified their expertise. At Gap, I'll do the same: start with leadership to understand strategic priorities, then work with store managers, merchandisers, and operators to understand how they work — and build AI that makes every individual employee more capable at their specific job."

**The Two Benefits of AI (Mical's Framework):**

1. **Doing things you could never do without it** (most important)
2. **Enhancing employee experience and productivity by working WITH AI in the right way**

**The Leadership Principle:**

"I start with leadership, and I end with leadership. I never circumvent them. I'm not organizing from the bottom up — I'm enabling from the top down and the middle out, with leadership alignment at every step."

## THE ANCHOR STORY (AWS PROOF POINT)

**Problem:**
AWS sellers faced fragmented enablement (static HQ pages, mass emails, multiple tools), stigmatized as "not technical enough." AI tools existed, but sellers were hesitant. Compensation required precise forms. Sales plays required tight narratives. New products launched weekly. The gap wasn't model capability — it was confidence, clarity, and relevance.

**Solution:**
Mical shifted enablement from broadcast to behavior change:
1. Started with sellers, not tools — mapped SPIFs, compensation incentives, required forms, sales play flows
2. Built agentic workflows in production before asking anyone else to use them (automated reporting, GEO + Job Title analytics, retrieval flows, impression bias audits)
3. Reduced fear through 5-minute "recipes" — live workflows sellers could copy immediately
4. Moved from mass promotion to targeted activation — specific PODs, customized Slack channels, cohort-specific needs
5. Reframed executive perception — humanized adoption, removed stigma, assumed high intelligence in stakeholders

**Impact:**
- +17% attendance increase (153 → 179 avg/session)
- +50% increase in high-CSAT sessions (>4.9)
- +67% increase in sales plays covered (133 → 222)
- Behavior change: Sellers stopped asking "What is this tool?" and started asking "Can this help me win this deal?"

**Why This Maps to Gap:**
Enabled thousands of non-technical users. Built agentic workflows in production. Tied AI to real incentives. Measured behavior change, not just adoption metrics. Reframed narrative from "users aren't technical enough" to "systems aren't aligned to how people work."

## PRIORITY GAPS TO CLOSE (RESEARCH FOCUS)

**1. Business & Financial Framing** (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
- How to frame ROI for a CFO who doesn't care about AI, only about margin
- How to build investment models that show budget shrinking, not growing
- How to quantify "doing things you could never do without it"

**2. Failure, Risk & Judgment** (SECOND PRIORITY)
- How to structure risk/governance so Mical isn't the bottleneck
- How to enable brand executives to prevent disasters themselves
- When to kill an AI initiative — the "no" framework

**3. Operating Model & Governance** (THIRD PRIORITY)
- How to design an operating model that runs without Mical in every decision
- How to balance centralized AI strategy with federated execution across 4 brands
- How to structure decision rights, escalation paths, audit mechanisms

- Committed to: "Domain-agnostic methodology, starts with people, not processes"
- Shapes: First 30-day roadmap, use case prioritization, adoption narrative

🚨 **AI Benefits Framework**
- Committed to: (1) Doing things impossible without AI, (2) Enhancing employee experience
- Shapes: Use case prioritization (priority 1 = what was impossible before)

🚨 **Leadership Alignment Principle**
- Committed to: "Start with leadership, end with leadership, never circumvent"
- Shapes: Governance model, adoption approach, stakeholder engagement strategy

🚨 **Platform Philosophy**
- Committed to: "One agentic interface, not 100 tools"
- Shapes: Platform recommendation, vendor evaluation, build vs. buy decisions

## NEXT PHASE: ARGY RESEARCH (PHASE 1)

**Before building any frameworks, we need market intelligence.**

Research agenda:
1. Gap Inc. current AI initiatives (public announcements, earnings calls, press)
2. Retail AI landscape: what's working, what's hype, where the bodies are buried
3. How to quantify ROI when the goal is budget reduction, not growth
4. Risk/governance models from comparable retailers (Target, Walmart, Best Buy)
5. Operating models for AI at multi-brand enterprises
6. Workday and ServiceNow AI features (Gap's stack)
7. ChatGPT Enterprise vs. Claude for Work vs. CoPilot — real enterprise deployments
8. Retail-specific use cases with verified ROI (not vendor claims)

**Question for Mical before Argy starts:**

Which research area feels most urgent? Where are you most likely to be challenged in an interview or in the role?

Or should Argy proceed with all 8 in parallel?
