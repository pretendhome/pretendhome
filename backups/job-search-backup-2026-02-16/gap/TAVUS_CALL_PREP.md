## YOUR POSITIONING

### Your Unique Value:
1. **AI model provider partnerships**: You launched 27+ models at AWS (Stability AI, TwelveLabs, Luma AI)
2. **Enterprise GTM**: You grew Stability AI 5X YoY, enabled 500+ field sellers
3. **Cloud partnerships**: You know AWS Bedrock, SageMaker, cloud marketplace GTM
4. **Video AI experience**: You worked with TwelveLabs (video understanding) and Luma AI (video generation) — adjacent to Tavus

### What Tavus Needs (That You Can Provide):
1. **Cloud partnerships**: AWS, Google Cloud, Azure integrations and co-sell
2. **Model provider partnerships**: Integrate with LLM providers (Anthropic, Cohere, etc.)
3. **Enterprise GTM strategy**: Scale from startups to Fortune 10 systematically
4. **Field enablement**: Train sales/solutions engineers on technical positioning
5. **Strategic alliances**: Build partnerships with video platforms, CRM/sales tools, enterprise software

---

## CALL STRATEGY

### Phase 1: Let Him Pitch (5-10 minutes)
**Your role**: Be an engaged prospect

**Questions to ask** (show you're technical and strategic):
1. "How does Tavus handle latency for real-time video? What's your infrastructure?"
2. "What LLMs are you using for the conversational layer? (OpenAI, Anthropic, custom?)"
3. "How do you differentiate from Synthesia, HeyGen, D-ID?" (competitors)
4. "What's the typical enterprise deployment model? (API, managed service, on-prem?)"
5. "How are Docebo and CVS using Tavus? (Use case specifics)"

### Phase 2: Pivot to Your Background (2-3 minutes)
**After the demo**, say:

> "This is really compelling. Quick context on my background — I just wrapped up a 4-year run at AWS where I drove GenAI model provider partnerships. I launched 27+ models on Bedrock including Stability AI (grew them 5X YoY), TwelveLabs (video understanding), and Luma AI (video generation). I also built enterprise GTM for AWS Analytics across government and education.
> 
> I'm currently exploring my next role in AI partnerships or GTM strategy. Tavus is at an interesting inflection point — you've got product-market fit with early customers, but scaling to enterprise requires a different motion. That's exactly what I did at AWS."

### Phase 3: Probe for Opportunity (5 minutes)
**Ask**:
1. "Is Tavus building out a partnerships function? I didn't see VP/Director Partnerships roles posted."
2. "How do you currently go to market? Direct sales, partnerships, cloud marketplaces?"
3. "Are you building AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure partnerships? (I saw no public partnerships)"
4. "Who owns your GTM strategy and partnerships roadmap?"
5. "What's the plan for scaling from 'startups to Fortune 10' to 'Fortune 500 systematically'?"

### Phase 4: Position Yourself (If Interest)
**If they say** "we're thinking about partnerships" or "we need someone for that":

> "I'd love to explore how I could help. At AWS, I built the playbook for scaling AI model providers from early adoption to enterprise — exactly what Tavus needs as you move from Docebo/CVS to broader Fortune 500 adoption. 
> 
> Specifically, I could:
> - Build AWS/Google Cloud/Azure partnerships (co-sell, marketplace, technical integrations)
> - Define your enterprise GTM motion (field enablement, sales plays, customer segmentation)
> - Establish strategic alliances (CRM platforms, video tools, enterprise software)
> - Scale your solutions engineering team (I enabled 500+ field sellers at AWS)
> 
> Happy to continue the conversation with Hassaan or Quinn if there's mutual interest."

### Phase 5: Close (If No Immediate Interest)
**If they say** "we're not hiring for that right now":

> "No problem. I'm genuinely interested in what you're building. Let's stay in touch — if Tavus decides to build out partnerships or GTM strategy in the next 6-12 months, I'd love to reconnect. In the meantime, happy to be a sounding board on enterprise AI adoption."

**Then ask for an intro**:
> "Would you be open to introducing me to Hassaan or Quinn? I'd love to share some thoughts on how Tavus could accelerate enterprise adoption based on what I learned scaling AI providers at AWS."

## QUESTIONS TO ASK (PRIORITIZED)

### Technical (Show You Understand the Product):
1. "What's your latency for real-time video responses? (Sub-second?)"
2. "How do you handle lip-sync accuracy across 30+ languages?"
3. "What LLMs power the conversational layer? (OpenAI, Anthropic, custom?)"
4. "How do you train the perception models? (Emotion recognition, expression analysis)"
5. "What's the deployment model? (API-only, managed service, on-prem for enterprise?)"

### GTM (Show You Understand Their Business):
6. "How do Docebo, CVS, and Qualified use Tavus? (Specific use cases)"
7. "What's your typical sales cycle for enterprise? (3 months? 6 months?)"
8. "How do you currently enable your solutions engineers? (Training, playbooks, demos)"
9. "What's your competitive positioning vs. Synthesia, HeyGen, D-ID?"
10. "How do you think about cloud partnerships? (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure)"

### Strategic (Show You Think Like a Leader):
11. "What's the biggest GTM challenge right now? (Pipeline generation? Enterprise adoption? Field enablement?)"
12. "How do you plan to scale from 'startups to Fortune 10' to 'Fortune 500 systematically'?"
13. "Are you building a partner ecosystem? (System integrators, ISVs, resellers)"
14. "What's the vision for Tavus in 3 years? (Platform? Vertical solutions? Horizontal infrastructure?)"

## RED FLAGS TO WATCH FOR

1. **No partnerships function** → Opportunity (you could build it)
2. **Direct sales only** → They need partnerships/alliances strategy
3. **No cloud provider partnerships** → Major gap (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure are critical for enterprise AI)
4. **Solutions engineers struggling** → You've enabled 500+ field sellers
5. **Unclear enterprise GTM** → You built this at AWS for Analytics and GenAI

---

## YOUR PITCH (30-SECOND VERSION)

> "I spent 4 years at AWS driving GenAI model provider partnerships. I launched 27+ models on Bedrock, grew Stability AI 5X YoY, and enabled 500+ field sellers. Before that, I built enterprise GTM for AWS Analytics across government and education. I'm exploring my next role in AI partnerships or GTM strategy — specifically helping companies like Tavus scale from early customers to systematic Fortune 500 adoption. That's exactly what I did at AWS with Stability AI, TwelveLabs, and Luma AI."

---

## YOUR PITCH (2-MINUTE VERSION)

> "I just wrapped up 4 years at AWS where I drove GenAI model provider partnerships. I worked with 6 AI companies — xAI, Mistral, Stability AI, Luma AI, TwelveLabs, and Poolside — launching 27+ models on AWS Bedrock and SageMaker.
> 
> My biggest win was Stability AI: I grew their revenue 5X year-over-year by building their AWS partnership, enabling 500+ field sellers, and creating joint GTM plays for enterprise customers. I also worked with TwelveLabs (video understanding AI) and Luma AI (video generation) — both adjacent to what Tavus is building.
> 
> Before GenAI, I led Analytics GTM for AWS Public Sector, growing the business 24% YoY and founding the AWS Data Leadership Forum (291+ senior data leaders, 98+ CxOs).
> 
> I'm exploring my next role in AI partnerships or GTM strategy. Tavus is at an interesting inflection point — you've got product-market fit with early customers like Docebo and CVS, but scaling to enterprise requires a different motion: cloud partnerships, field enablement, strategic alliances, and systematic GTM. That's exactly what I built at AWS.
> 
> If Tavus is thinking about building out a partnerships function or scaling enterprise GTM, I'd love to explore how I can help."
