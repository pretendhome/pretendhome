======================================================================

All significant decisions logged in real time.

## [2026-02-12] — Success Definition: Human Voice, Not Hero Operator

**Context**: Defining what success looks like for Mical in Year 1 at Gap

**Options considered**:
- High-impact pilot executor (Mical ships the pilots)
- Governance architect (Mical prevents disasters)
- Enabler and amplifier (Mical helps others ship pilots and prevent disasters)

**Decision**: Enabler and amplifier — "the human voice associated with AI transformation"

**Reasoning**:
- Mical's strength is making people comfortable with AI, not being the bottleneck
- High-impact pilots should come FROM the people who understand the business
- Brand executives should prevent disasters themselves — Mical enables them
- Success = budget shrinks because things were done right, not budget doubles to prove ROI

**ONE-WAY DOOR?**: Yes — this shapes the entire operating model, governance structure, and adoption approach

**Approved by**: Mical

**Implications**:
- First 30-day roadmap must prioritize leadership interviews and operator listening
- Governance model must enable decision-making, not centralize it
- Use case prioritization must involve business owners, not be dictated by AI team
- ROI framework must show cost reduction, not growth investment

## [2026-02-12] — Positioning: Domain-Agnostic Methodology, Not Retail Expertise

**Context**: How to frame the retail experience gap when Gap asks

**Options considered**:
- Claim transferable retail-adjacent experience (HR tech, enterprise enablement)
- Acknowledge gap and commit to learning retail operations
- Reframe as domain-agnostic methodology that starts with people, not processes

**Decision**: Domain-agnostic methodology — "I understand how AI should be used correctly by anyone"

**Reasoning**:
- Mical doesn't have retail operations experience — claiming it would be dishonest
- The skill isn't knowing retail — it's knowing how to translate AI capability into workflows that match real incentives
- AWS proof point: enabled sellers across 50+ GEOs without being a seller
- Stronger positioning: "I will take the time to speak to store managers and merchandisers to understand their needs"

**ONE-WAY DOOR?**: Yes — this framing shapes the entire plan, especially first 30-day roadmap and use case prioritization

**Approved by**: Mical

**Implications**:
- Plan must emphasize listening and discovery, not prescriptive solutions
- Use cases must be co-created with business owners, not imposed
- First 30 days must include structured interviews with store managers, merchandisers, supply chain operators
- Narrative must avoid claiming retail expertise Mical doesn't have

## [2026-02-12] — AI Benefits Framework: Two Core Benefits

**Context**: Defining the value proposition for AI at Gap

**Options considered**:
- Standard enterprise AI benefits (productivity, cost reduction, revenue growth)
- Mical's framework: (1) Doing things impossible without AI, (2) Enhancing employee experience

**Decision**: Mical's framework — prioritize "doing things you could never do without it" as most important

**Reasoning**:
- Productivity gains are table stakes — not differentiating
- The real value is unlocking capabilities that were impossible before
- Employee experience enhancement is secondary but critical for adoption
- This framing aligns with "AI as amplification, not replacement"

**ONE-WAY DOOR?**: Yes — this shapes use case prioritization (priority 1 = what was impossible before)

**Approved by**: Mical

**Implications**:
- Use case prioritization matrix must rank "impossible without AI" as highest weight
- ROI framework must quantify value of new capabilities, not just efficiency gains
- Adoption narrative must emphasize "you can now do X" not "you can do X faster"

## [2026-02-12] — Leadership Alignment Principle: Start and End with Leadership

**Context**: How to approach organizational change at Gap

**Options considered**:
- Bottom-up adoption (grassroots, champions program)
- Top-down mandate (executive-driven rollout)
- Middle-out with leadership alignment (Mical's approach)

**Decision**: "I start with leadership, and I end with leadership. I never circumvent them."

**Reasoning**:
- Mical is not a union organizer — not organizing from the bottom up
- Leadership owns strategic priorities and must own AI decisions
- Middle-out approach (enable operators) but always with leadership alignment
- Prevents shadow AI and ensures governance

**ONE-WAY DOOR?**: Yes — this shapes governance model, adoption approach, stakeholder engagement strategy

**Approved by**: Mical

**Implications**:
- First 30-day roadmap must start with leadership interviews
- Governance model must position leadership as decision-makers, not Mical
- Adoption approach must be "top-down and middle-out" not bottom-up
- All pilots must have executive sponsorship before launch

## [2026-02-12] — Platform Philosophy: One Agentic Interface, Not 100 Tools

**Context**: How to approach AI platform selection and architecture at Gap

**Options considered**:
- Best-of-breed tool sprawl (ChatGPT + Claude + CoPilot + specialized tools)
- Single vendor platform (Microsoft CoPilot for everything)
- Agentic interface (Palette-style) that uses core tools to serve multiple personas

**Decision**: One agentic interface, not 100 tools

**Reasoning**:
- Tool sprawl creates adoption friction, maintenance burden, cost bloat
- Employees don't need 100 tools — they need one interface that understands their job
- Agentic system auto-improves, uses core capabilities (research, architecture, build, validate, monitor)
- Aligns with "budget shrinks because we did it right"

**ONE-WAY DOOR?**: Yes — this shapes platform recommendation, vendor evaluation, build vs. buy decisions

**Approved by**: Mical

**Implications**:
- Platform recommendation must prioritize agentic architecture over tool collection
- Build vs. buy framework must evaluate vendor platforms on extensibility and agent orchestration
- ROI model must account for reduced tool sprawl and maintenance costs
- Technical architecture must support multi-agent workflows, not just single-tool access

## [2026-02-12] — Priority Gaps: Business/Financial Framing First

**Context**: Which of the 10 question categories to prioritize in research and frameworks

**Options considered**:
- Technical depth (Mical's strength, least exposed)
- Use-case specific retail (most obvious gap)
- Business & financial framing (most exposed, hardest to fake)

**Decision**: Prioritize (1) Business & Financial Framing, (2) Failure/Risk/Judgment, (3) Operating Model & Governance

**Reasoning**:
- Mical is a builder and enabler — technical depth and adoption are strengths
- The gap is operational execution at enterprise scale
- CFO-level ROI framing is hardest to fake and most critical for executive buy-in
- Risk/governance and operating model are researchable and framework-able

**ONE-WAY DOOR?**: No — research priority order, can adjust based on findings

**Approved by**: Mical

**Implications**:
- Phase 1 research must prioritize ROI models, risk frameworks, operating models
- Phase 5 (ROI framework) and Phase 6 (Risk/Governance) are most critical deliverables
- Interview answer library must have strongest answers in these categories

## NEXT DECISION POINT

**Phase 1 Research Scope**: Should Argy proceed with all 8 research areas in parallel, or prioritize specific areas first?

Awaiting Mical's input.
