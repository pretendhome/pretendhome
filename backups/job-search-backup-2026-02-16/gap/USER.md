- Native French, fluent Italian, proficient Spanish
- Knowledge architecture + linguistics background (rare in AI practitioners)

## Communication Preferences
- Concise, no fluff, no flattery

- Key insight: "Users aren't technical enough" → "Systems aren't aligned to how people work"

## Constraints for Gap Engagement
- Must be interview-ready (can present to Gap leadership)
- CFO-defensible numbers (conservative estimates, traceable sources)
- No unverifiable claims (all ROI backed by research or comparables)
- Operations-first approach (low brand safety risk, clear ROI)
- "AI as amplification, not replacement" positioning

## Growth Edges (from FDE field partner brief)
- Backend ownership
- Unfamiliar codebases
- Infra/perf awareness
- GTM framing
- Sales pressure

## Success Criteria (from Convergence Brief)
- Be the human voice that makes people comfortable with AI (not afraid)
- Enable others to prevent disasters (not do it for them)
- Kill bad ideas (AI replacing people, tool sprawl, vendor hype)
- Budget shrinks because we did it right (not doubles to prove ROI)
