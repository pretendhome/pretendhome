## IMPLICATIONS FOR OFFICE OF AI

### What Gap Has (Strengths)

✅ **Executive Commitment**: CEO Richard Dickson's "digital-first" vision
✅ **AI Innovation Unit**: Established 2024 (foundation exists)
✅ **Google Cloud Partnership**: Gemini, Vertex AI, BigQuery (platform exists)
✅ **Financial Performance**: Strong margins, positive cash flow (budget available)
✅ **Brand Momentum**: 8 consecutive quarters of market share gains (business is working)
✅ **CTO Leadership**: Sven Gerjets (30+ years experience, reports to CEO)

---

### What Gap Needs (Gaps)

❌ **No Office of AI**: AI innovation unit exists, but no formal Office of AI structure
❌ **No AI Leadership Role**: No Chief AI Officer, no Sr. Manager AI Strategy (Mical's role is new)
❌ **Early Implementation**: AI experimentation in culture, but not scaled to operations (stores, supply chain)
❌ **200+ AI Models**: Consolidating into Gemini, but fragmented (tool sprawl)
❌ **Unknown Enterprise Stack**: Workday, ServiceNow, Salesforce not confirmed (need discovery)
❌ **No FDE Model**: No evidence of embedded AI teams with business units
❌ **No Governance Framework**: No public disclosure of AI governance, risk management, compliance

---

### Office of AI Opportunity

**Mical's Role** (Sr. Manager, AI Strategy & Enterprise Enablement):

**Year 1 Mission**: Operationalize Gap's AI strategy
1. **Build Office of AI** (FDE-heavy team: 6 FDEs + 3-4 support)
2. **Embed FDEs with business units** (stores, merchandising, supply chain, brands)
3. **Integrate AI onto existing infrastructure** (not build from scratch)
4. **Establish governance framework** (risk, compliance, brand safety)
5. **Scale from experimentation to operations** (move beyond "test, learn" to "deploy, measure, optimize")
6. **Consolidate 200+ AI models** (leverage Gemini Enterprise, reduce tool sprawl)
7. **Enable employees** (behavior change, not just training)

**Year 2 Mission**: Scale across all 4 brands
- Prove ROI in pilot brands (Old Navy, Gap)
- Expand to Banana Republic, Athleta
- Cross-brand learning and replication

**Year 3 Mission**: Budget reduction through efficiency
- One agentic system replaces tool sprawl
- Maintenance costs reduced 30-40%
- Budget shrinks because we did it right

## COMPETITIVE POSITIONING

**Gap vs Competitors**:

| Retailer | AI Maturity | Platform | Team Structure | Budget |
|----------|-------------|----------|----------------|--------|
| **Walmart** | Advanced | System-centric agentic (Sparky, My Assistant, Marty) | Centralized (Walmart Global Tech) | $500M |
| **Target** | Moderate | Targeted operational (Trend Brain, Store Companion) | Federated (no central AI office) | Not disclosed |
| **LVMH** | Advanced | Maison autonomy (MaIA: 40K employees, 2M+ requests) | Hybrid (central platform + 75 maisons) | Not disclosed |
| **Gap** | Early | Google Cloud (Gemini, Vertex AI, BigQuery) | AI innovation unit (no Office of AI yet) | Not disclosed |

**Gap's Position**: Behind Walmart and LVMH in maturity, ahead of Target in platform investment, but early in operationalization.

**Office of AI Opportunity**: Accelerate Gap from "early" to "moderate" in Year 1, "advanced" by Year 3.

## VALIDATION QUESTIONS FOR MICAL

Before moving to Cycle 5 (Retail AI Landscape):

1. **Gap's current state match your understanding?** Any surprises or corrections?

2. **Google Cloud partnership — does this constrain or enable the FDE model?** (Gemini Enterprise as the platform)

3. **200+ AI models consolidating — is this an opportunity or a problem?** (Tool sprawl being addressed, but by whom?)

4. **First 30 days discovery agenda feel right?** Or should we prioritize differently?

5. **Ready for Cycle 5 (Retail AI Landscape)?** Or dig deeper on Gap current state first?
