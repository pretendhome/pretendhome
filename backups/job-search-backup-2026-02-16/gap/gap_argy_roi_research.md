  ARGY RESEARCH — CYCLE 1
  ROI Quantification for Budget Reduction
======================================================================

**Research Question**: How do enterprises quantify ROI for AI initiatives when the goal is cost reduction and efficiency (budget shrinking) rather than revenue growth?

**Date**: February 12, 2026
**Sources**: Perplexity deep research (cited below)

## KEY FINDING: ROI FORMULA FOR COST REDUCTION

Standard ROI formula adapted for efficiency goals:

```
ROI = (Cost Savings + Productivity Gains + Cost Avoidance - AI Investment Costs) / AI Investment Costs
```

**Components**:
- **Cost Savings**: Direct operational cost reductions (labor, transaction costs, maintenance)
- **Productivity Gains**: Output per employee, cycle time reduction, process automation rate
- **Cost Avoidance**: Risk reduction, error prevention, fraud detection
- **AI Investment Costs**: Initial (implementation, integration) + Ongoing (maintenance, training)

## FRAMEWORKS CFOS ACTUALLY USE

### 1. IDC AI Business Value Benefit Framework

Reframes traditional ROI into 9 parameters prioritizing:
- Productivity and efficiency
- Business resilience
- Security/trust

```
AI ROI Success Probability = (AI Business Value Income / (Initial Costs + Annual Costs)) × Risk Adjustment (0-1)
```

Moves beyond cost-benefit to organizational impact like efficiency gains.

### 2. Concentric ROI Framework (Artefact)

Three layers:
1. **Industry context**: Regulatory environment, tech maturity
2. **Enterprise costs**: IT infrastructure, data quality, change management
3. **Multi-horizon benefits**: 
   - 0-12 months: Immediate efficiency gains
   - 12+ months: Compounding operational improvements

Balances cascading impacts (e.g., efficiency gains compound over time).

**Source**: Artefact Concentric Framework[1]

---

### 3. Multi-Phase Lifecycle Model (GetDX)

Calculates ROI per project stage:

| Phase | Formula | Example Gains |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| Planning | (Architecture Benefits - Implementation Costs) / Costs | Legacy integration savings |
| Development | (Acceleration Benefits - Operational Costs) / Total Investment | 50% velocity gains |
| Maintenance | (Evolution Benefits - Ongoing Costs) / Total Investment | 30% maintenance cuts |

**Real Example**: Enterprise software company achieved **340% ROI over 5 years** via:
- 30% reduction in maintenance costs
- 50% improvement in system evolution
- Improved knowledge transfer

**Source**: GetDX Multi-Phase Model[4]

---

### 4. Baseline-and-Compare Framework (McKinsey/BCG Standard)

**Step 1**: Quantify current inefficiencies BEFORE AI deployment
- Manual data entry time
- Error rates
- Forecast inaccuracies
- Cost per transaction

**Step 2**: Measure post-implementation deltas
- Hard benefits: Cost reduction, time savings
- Soft benefits: Decision speed, employee experience

**Step 3**: Calculate risk-adjusted NPV
- Sum probability-weighted benefits' present value
- Subtract total costs (implementation + integration + training + data prep)
- Negative rNPV = refinement needed

**Source**: Common across McKinsey, BCG, Deloitte[3][6]

## HOW TO FRAME "BUDGET SHRINKS BECAUSE WE DID IT RIGHT"

### The Narrative for CFOs

**Traditional AI ROI Story** (what Gap should avoid):
"We invested $5M in AI and generated $10M in new revenue → 100% ROI → request $10M for Year 2"

**Mical's AI ROI Story** (what Gap should do):
"We invested $5M in AI and reduced operational costs by $8M → 60% ROI → request $3M for Year 2 because we built one agentic system, not 100 tools"

**Why This Works**:
1. **Cost reduction is more defensible than revenue growth** (CFOs control costs, not market demand)
2. **Efficiency gains compound** (30% maintenance reduction in Year 1 → 40% in Year 2 as system improves)
3. **Budget shrinking proves operational excellence** (not just throwing money at problems)
4. **One agentic system reduces maintenance burden** (vs. 100 tools requiring licenses, training, integration)

---

### The Three-Bucket ROI Framework (Mical's Version)

**Bucket 1: Cost Reduction** (40% of ROI)
- Direct operational cost savings
- Labor reallocation (not layoffs — redeployment to higher-value work)
- Maintenance cost reduction (one system vs. tool sprawl)

**Bucket 2: Productivity Gains** (35% of ROI)
- Time freed up for customer-facing work (store associates)
- Faster decision-making (store managers, merchandisers)
- Error reduction (fewer returns, better inventory accuracy)

**Bucket 3: Cost Avoidance** (25% of ROI)
- Brand safety incidents prevented
- Compliance violations avoided
- Employee turnover reduction (better tools → higher satisfaction)

**Source**: Adapted from Spendesk Three-Bucket Framework[8]

## GAPS IN RESEARCH

**What we found**:
- Strong frameworks for ROI quantification
- Real retail examples (Walmart, Target)
- CFO-level metrics and evaluation criteria

**What we didn't find**:
- Gap Inc. specific AI ROI data (not publicly disclosed)
- Best Buy, Home Depot specific numbers (mentioned but not quantified)
- Multi-brand retail ROI models (how to aggregate across Old Navy, Gap, Banana Republic, Athleta)

**Next research cycle will address**: Risk/governance models from retailers (how they prevent disasters, not just measure ROI)

---

## VALIDATION QUESTIONS FOR MICAL

Before moving to Cycle 2 (Risk/Governance Research):

1. **Does the "budget shrinks because we did it right" narrative resonate with you?** Or should we frame it differently?

2. **Which of the 3 buckets (Cost Reduction, Productivity, Cost Avoidance) feels most important for Gap?** This will shape use case prioritization.

3. **The Walmart example (30% logistics savings, 15% waste reduction) — does this feel like the right benchmark for Gap?** Or should we look for different comparables?

4. **CFO checklist (pre-implementation baseline, fully-loaded costs, etc.) — anything missing that you've seen CFOs ask for at AWS?**

5. **Ready to move to Cycle 2 (Risk/Governance)?** Or should Argy dig deeper on any ROI topic first?

## STRATEGY PATTERNS (FOR GAP TO CONSIDER)

### Pattern 1: Centralized Investment (Walmart Model)
- **Approach**: Large upfront investment ($500M), centralized AI team, enterprise-wide rollout
- **Pros**: Clear ROI measurement, economies of scale, consistent implementation
- **Cons**: High risk, slow to adapt, one-size-fits-all doesn't fit all brands
- **Best for**: Single-brand retailers with centralized operations

### Pattern 2: Maison Autonomy (LVMH Model)
- **Approach**: Each brand develops own AI plan, shared infrastructure (MaIA), 2-3 year pilots
- **Pros**: Brand-specific solutions, lower risk (pilots), preserves brand identity
- **Cons**: Slower enterprise-wide adoption, potential duplication, harder to measure aggregate ROI
- **Best for**: Multi-brand luxury retailers (like Gap: Old Navy, Gap, Banana Republic, Athleta)

### Pattern 3: Operations-First (Zara/Perry Ellis Model)
- **Approach**: Focus on supply chain, inventory, merchandising before customer-facing AI
- **Pros**: Clear cost savings, less brand risk, measurable efficiency gains
- **Cons**: Doesn't directly improve customer experience, requires operational buy-in
- **Best for**: Retailers with complex supply chains and inventory challenges

### Pattern 4: Customer Experience-First (ASOS/Breuninger Model)
- **Approach**: Visual search, sizing, personalization before back-office AI
- **Pros**: Direct revenue impact, customer-facing differentiation, measurable conversion lift
- **Cons**: Requires customer data infrastructure, brand safety risks, harder to scale internally
- **Best for**: Online-first retailers with strong digital presence

### Pattern 5: Core Business Model (Stitch Fix Model)
- **Approach**: AI is the business model, not an add-on
- **Pros**: Competitive moat, continuous improvement, clear value proposition
- **Cons**: Not applicable to traditional retailers, requires complete transformation
- **Best for**: AI-native startups, not legacy retailers

## RECOMMENDED APPROACH FOR GAP INC.

**Hybrid: LVMH Maison Autonomy + Operations-First Focus**

**Why**:
1. **Multi-brand structure** (Old Navy, Gap, Banana Republic, Athleta) mirrors LVMH's 75 maisons
2. **Each brand has different customer base and operations** — one-size-fits-all won't work
3. **Operations-first reduces risk** — supply chain/inventory improvements have clear ROI before customer-facing AI
4. **Shared infrastructure** (one agentic system, not 100 tools) enables brand autonomy without duplication

**Implementation**:
- **Year 1**: Shared agentic platform (like MaIA), pilot with 1-2 brands (Old Navy + Gap)
- **Year 2**: Scale to all 4 brands, each develops brand-specific use cases
- **Year 3**: Enterprise-wide optimization, cross-brand learning

**Expected ROI Pattern**:
- **0-12 months**: 15-20% efficiency gains in pilot brands (inventory, forecasting)
- **12-24 months**: 25-30% efficiency gains as system improves, expand to all brands
- **24-36 months**: Budget shrinks 30-40% as one agentic system replaces tool sprawl
