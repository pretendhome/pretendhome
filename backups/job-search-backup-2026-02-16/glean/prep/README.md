## YOUR CORE NARRATIVE

### The Story:

Before that, I drove GenAI partnerships at AWS, launching 27+ models and growing Stability AI 5X YoY. I'm good at translating customer problems into AI solutions, building with customers, and measuring outcomes. That's what Glean needs."

3. **AWS Public Sector**: 24% YoY growth, 291+ data leaders, 98+ CxOs

### The Fit:
- **Design AI agents**: Palette's 7 agent archetypes prove this
- **Work with customers**: AWS Public Sector GTM proves this
- **Ship outcomes**: Palette's 3 active projects prove this

## INTERVIEW STRATEGY

### Phase 1: Opening (2 minutes)
**Goal**: Establish credibility immediately

**What to Say**:
- Lead with Palette (proof you've shipped AI outcomes)
- Bridge to AWS GenAI partnerships (proof you understand LLMs)
- Close with customer-facing experience (proof you can work consultatively)

**Why This Works**:
- Addresses all three "must-haves" in the job description
- Differentiates you from candidates who only have theory
- Sets the tone: you're a builder and executor, not just a talker

---

### Phase 2: Demo Scenario (15-20 minutes)
**Goal**: Show how you'd work with a Glean customer

**What to Do**:
1. Use 4-question framework (pattern, data, repetitive, measurable)
2. Design agent workflow (input → retrieval → generation → human-in-the-loop)
3. Scope pilot (12 weeks, 5-10 users, clear success metrics, kill criteria)
4. Propose rollout plan (expand if metrics hit targets, iterate based on feedback)

**Why This Works**:
- Shows you can translate business needs into AI solutions
- Demonstrates consultative approach (discovery → design → pilot → rollout)
- Proves you understand how to measure outcomes (usage, efficiency, business results)

---

### Phase 3: Q&A (20-30 minutes)
**Goal**: Answer their questions confidently and ask intelligent questions

**What to Do**:
- Answer questions about Palette, AWS, customer work (use cheat sheet)
- Ask intelligent questions about Glean's product, customers, roadmap (use cheat sheet)
- Probe for role clarity (success metrics, team structure, collaboration with Product/R&D)

**Why This Works**:
- Shows you've done your homework (researched Glean, understand the market)
- Demonstrates curiosity and strategic thinking
- Helps you assess if this role is the right fit

---

### Phase 4: Closing (2 minutes)
**Goal**: Reiterate fit and express excitement

**What to Say**:
"I'm excited about this role because it combines everything I'm good at: designing AI solutions, working with customers, and shipping measurable outcomes. I've spent 2.5 years building Palette and 4 years enabling AI adoption at AWS. I know how to translate customer problems into AI solutions, build those solutions with customers, and measure outcomes that matter to their business. That's exactly what Glean needs, and I'm ready to start."

**Why This Works**:
- Reinforces your core narrative
- Expresses genuine excitement (not just going through the motions)
- Ends on a strong, confident note

## KEY FRAMEWORKS TO USE

### 4-Question Framework (Use in Demo Scenario)
1. Is there a pattern?
2. Is there data?
3. Is it repetitive or high-volume?
4. Can you measure success?

### Agent Workflow Design (Use in Demo Scenario)
1. **Input**: What does the user provide?
2. **Retrieval**: What data does the agent need?
3. **Generation**: What does the agent produce?
4. **Human-in-the-loop**: Where does the user review and edit?

### Pilot Scoping (Use in Demo Scenario)
- **Duration**: 12 weeks
- **Users**: 5-10 users
- **Success criteria**: 80%+ usage, 50%+ time savings, 4.5+ satisfaction
- **Kill criteria**: <50% usage, <30% time savings, <4.0 satisfaction

### Success Metrics (Use in Q&A)
- **Usage metrics**: Daily/weekly active users, frequency, retention
- **Efficiency metrics**: Time saved, tasks completed, error reduction
- **Business outcome metrics**: Win rate, sales cycle, customer satisfaction

## COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

### 1. Talking Too Much About Theory
- Don't: "AI agents are the future of work..."
- Do: "I built Palette — here's how it works and what it's shipped..."

### 2. Not Asking Questions
- Don't: Just answer their questions and wait for next steps
- Do: Ask intelligent questions about product, customers, roadmap, role

### 3. Being Vague About Outcomes
- Don't: "Palette helps me work faster..."
- Do: "Palette reduced interview prep time from 4-6 hours to 20 minutes (15X faster)"

### 4. Not Showing Customer Empathy
- Don't: "I'd build an AI agent that does X..."
- Do: "I'd start with discovery: What does success mean to you? What's the current process?"

### 5. Overselling AI Capabilities
- Don't: "AI can automate everything..."
- Do: "AI can generate a first draft, but you'll need to review and finalize it"
