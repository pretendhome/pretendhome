Subject: GenAI GTM Leader | 27+ Model Launches at AWS

Hi [CEO/CRO Name],

I've spent the last 1.5 years at AWS driving GenAI model provider adoption — 27+ launches across xAI, Mistral, Stability AI, Luma AI, TwelveLabs, and Poolside. I grew Stability AI 5X YoY and enabled 500+ field sellers.

Before AWS, I scaled Intel's XScale from $7M to $450M and doubled first-year revenue at Acumera (MSSP).

I'm exploring my next leadership role in GenAI partnerships/GTM. If [Company] is building out enterprise GTM or cloud partnerships, I'd love to connect.

Best,
Tom Yemington
