## SEARCH INSIGHTS

### What We Found:
- **7 VP/Director level roles** posted in last 30 days (Feb 2026)
- **3 in Austin** (W3Global, Visa, Teradata)
- **2 remote-friendly** (ServiceNow, Presidio)
- **2 at AI model/infrastructure companies** (Anthropic, WEKA)
- **Match scores: 70-88%** (all strong fits for Tom's profile)

### What We Didn't Find:
- **No current openings** at Tom's top target companies: Cohere, Hugging Face, Databricks, Snowflake, Together AI, Jasper, Google Cloud AI, Oracle Cloud, CrowdStrike
- **Limited GenAI startup roles** (Harvey, Glean, Writer, Perplexity AI, Character.AI, Cerebras, Groq, Wiz, Lacework, Scale AI, Weights & Biases, LangChain)
- **Reason**: These companies either:
  1. Not actively hiring for partnerships/GTM leadership right now
  2. Hiring but not posting publicly (recruiter-sourced only)
  3. Filled roles recently (pre-February 2026)

### Market Observations:
1. **Austin market is thin** for VP-level AI partnerships roles (only 3 found)
2. **Remote roles are more abundant** (ServiceNow, Presidio, WEKA)
3. **AI infrastructure companies** (WEKA, ServiceNow) are actively hiring partnerships leaders
4. **Model providers** (Anthropic) are hiring reseller/channel partnerships (not direct enterprise partnerships)
5. **Timing matters**: Most target companies likely hire in waves (post-funding rounds, post-product launches)

## WARM OUTREACH TEMPLATE

```
Subject: GenAI GTM Leader | 27+ Model Launches at AWS

Hi [Name],

I saw [Company] is hiring for [Role]. I've spent the last 1.5 years at AWS driving GenAI model provider adoption — 27+ launches across xAI, Mistral, Stability AI, Luma AI, TwelveLabs, and Poolside. I grew Stability AI 5X YoY and enabled 500+ field sellers.

Before AWS, I scaled Intel's XScale from $7M to $450M and doubled first-year revenue at Acumera (MSSP).

Given my experience bridging AI providers and enterprise customers, I'd love to connect about the [Role] opportunity. Are you open to a brief conversation?

Best,
Tom Yemington
[LinkedIn] | [Email] | [Phone]

Before AWS, I scaled Intel's XScale from $7M to $450M and doubled first-year revenue at Acumera (MSSP).

If [Company] is building out enterprise GTM or cloud partnerships, I'd love to explore how I can help. Open to a brief conversation?
