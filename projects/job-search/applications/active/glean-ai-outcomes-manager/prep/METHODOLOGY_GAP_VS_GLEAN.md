# INTERVIEW PREP METHODOLOGY — GAP vs GLEAN

**Purpose**: Document the interview prep process for future roles  
**Date**: February 15, 2026

---

## THE PATTERN

Both Gap and Glean interviews followed the same core structure, but with different emphasis based on the role:

### Gap (Sr. Manager, AI Strategy & Enterprise Enablement)
**Role Type**: Internal transformation strategy (enabler role)  
**Focus**: Enterprise-wide governance, adoption frameworks, strategic positioning  
**Proof Points**: AWS enablement (+17% attendance, +50% high-CSAT), Palette architecture

### Glean (AI Outcomes Manager)
**Role Type**: External customer outcomes delivery (executor role)  
**Focus**: Hands-on agent design, customer engagement, measurable outcomes  
**Proof Points**: Palette production system (7 agents, 3 active projects), AWS GenAI partnerships

---

## THE 5-PHASE PROCESS

### Phase 1: Foundation & Positioning (30 minutes)
**What**: Define your core narrative and competitive advantages

**Gap Approach**:
- Positioned as "enabler, not executor"
- Domain-agnostic methodology (not retail expertise)
- AWS anchor story (enablement behavior change)
- Two AI benefits framework (impossible without AI + employee experience)

**Glean Approach**:
- Positioned as "builder and executor"
- Palette as proof of shipped outcomes (not demos)
- AWS GenAI partnerships (LLM expertise)
- 4-Question Method framework (pattern, data, repetitive, measurable)

**Key Insight**: Tailor positioning to role type (enabler vs. executor)

---

### Phase 2: Deep Research (1-2 hours)
**What**: Understand the company, product, market, and role

**Gap Approach** (Argy-led research):
- ROI models and financial framing
- Risk/governance frameworks
- Operating model research (FDE model, LVMH governance)
- Retail landscape analysis
- Current state research (Gap's ~200 AI models, tool sprawl)

**Glean Approach** (Streamlined research):
- Company overview (founding, mission, product evolution)
- Product architecture (search, assistant, agent builder)
- Funding & valuation ($360M+, $2.2B valuation)
- Market position (competitors, differentiation)
- Customer insights (use cases, success metrics, objections)

**Key Insight**: Gap required more research (unfamiliar domain), Glean required less (familiar domain)

---

### Phase 3: Strategic Frameworks (1-2 hours)
**What**: Build frameworks that demonstrate your thinking

**Gap Approach** (Rex-led frameworks):
- 5 big ideas (FDE model, LVMH governance, operations-first, behavior change, budget shrinks)
- Use case deep dives (inventory forecasting, store associate assistant, markdown optimization)
- Adoption framework (champions, 5-minute recipes, persona-specific UX)
- Executive narrative (seams theory, staffing inversion, new data streams)

**Glean Approach** (Simplified frameworks):
- 4-Question Method (pattern, data, repetitive, measurable)
- Agent workflow design (input → retrieval → generation → human-in-the-loop)
- Pilot scoping (12 weeks, 5-10 users, success metrics, kill criteria)
- Success metrics (usage, efficiency, business outcomes)

**Key Insight**: Gap required strategic frameworks (enterprise transformation), Glean required tactical frameworks (customer engagement)

---

### Phase 4: Validation (30 minutes)
**What**: Check for coherence, accuracy, and completeness

**Gap Approach** (Anky-led validation):
- Architecture audit (is the plan coherent?)
- Memory validation (are all artifacts aligned?)
- Coherence check (does the narrative hold together?)

**Glean Approach** (Self-validation):
- Does the opening statement address all "must-haves"?
- Does the demo scenario show customer empathy?
- Are the proof points credible and verifiable?

**Key Insight**: Gap required formal validation (complex plan), Glean required informal validation (simpler plan)

---

### Phase 5: Interview Prep (1-2 hours)
**What**: Create interview materials (cheat sheet, Q&A, demo script)

**Gap Approach**:
- Interview cheat sheet (11.6KB)
- Answer library for 10 question categories
- Out-of-the-box differentiators (seams theory, staffing inversion, new data streams)
- 3-year ROI model ($37.9M-$65M benefit on $7.2M-$7.8M investment)

**Glean Approach**:
- Interview package (26KB)
- Research brief (13KB)
- Interview cheat sheet (8.3KB)
- Palette demo script (12KB)
- README (12KB)

**Key Insight**: Both approaches created comprehensive materials, but Glean was more modular (5 documents vs. 1-2 documents)

---

## WHAT STAYED THE SAME

### 1. Core Narrative Structure
- **Opening statement**: Lead with proof points (Palette, AWS)
- **Demo scenario**: Show how you'd work with the customer/company
- **Q&A**: Answer questions confidently, ask intelligent questions

- **AWS Public Sector**: 24% YoY growth, 291+ data leaders, 98+ CxOs

### 3. Frameworks
- **4-Question Method**: Pattern, data, repetitive, measurable (used in both)
- **Success metrics**: Usage, efficiency, business outcomes (used in both)
- **Pilot scoping**: 12 weeks, 5-10 users, clear success metrics, kill criteria (used in both)

### 4. Materials
- **Cheat sheet**: Quick reference for interview day
- **Research brief**: Deep dive on company, product, market
- **Demo scenario**: Show how you'd work with customer/company
- **Q&A library**: Top 10 questions with answers

---

## WHAT CHANGED

## KEY LESSONS LEARNED

### 1. Tailor Positioning to Role Type
- **Enabler roles** (Gap): Emphasize strategic thinking, governance, adoption frameworks
- **Executor roles** (Glean): Emphasize hands-on building, customer engagement, measurable outcomes

### 2. Research Depth Depends on Domain Familiarity
- **Unfamiliar domain** (Gap retail): Deep research required (8+ documents)
- **Familiar domain** (Glean AI/SaaS): Streamlined research sufficient (5 documents)

### 3. Frameworks Should Match Role Complexity
- **Strategic roles** (Gap): Complex frameworks (enterprise transformation, governance, ROI)
- **Tactical roles** (Glean): Simple frameworks (customer engagement, agent design, pilot scoping)

### 4. Proof Points Are Reusable
- Palette, AWS GenAI, AWS Public Sector work for both roles
- Emphasis changes (Palette architecture for Gap, Palette outcomes for Glean)
- Same proof points, different framing

### 5. Demo Scenarios Are Critical
- **Gap**: Show how you'd enable enterprise transformation (leadership alignment, pilot design, adoption framework)
- **Glean**: Show how you'd work with a customer (discovery, agent design, pilot scoping, outcome measurement)

### 6. Materials Should Be Modular
- **Glean approach is better**: 5 separate documents (package, research, cheat sheet, demo, README)
- **Gap approach was monolithic**: 1-2 large documents
- Modular is easier to navigate and rehearse from
