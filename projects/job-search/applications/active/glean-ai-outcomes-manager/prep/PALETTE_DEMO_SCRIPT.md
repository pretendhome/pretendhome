# PALETTE DEMO SCRIPT FOR GLEAN INTERVIEW

**Purpose**: Show how you design and build AI agents in practice  
**Duration**: 10-15 minutes (if they ask)  
**Proof Point**: You've shipped AI outcomes, not just demos

---

## SETUP (30 seconds)

"Let me show you how Palette works. I'll walk through a real example from one of my active projects — preparing a 30-minute demo on agentic systems for an interview. This demonstrates how I design multi-agent workflows, ship outcomes, and measure success."

---

## THE PROBLEM (1 minute)

**Context**: I needed to prepare a 30-minute demo on agentic systems for an interview. The demo needed to:
- Teach agentic concepts clearly
- Include concrete examples
- Have interview scenarios with answer frameworks
- Be ready in 20 minutes (not 4-6 hours)

**Why This Is Hard**:
- Requires research (what are the top AI use cases?)
- Requires structure (how do I teach this in 30 minutes?)
- Requires examples (what are realistic interview scenarios?)
- Requires validation (is this coherent and accurate?)

**Traditional Approach**: 4-6 hours of manual work (research, outline, write, validate)

**Palette Approach**: 20 minutes with multi-agent workflow

---

## STEP 1: PROBLEM CLASSIFICATION (1 minute)

**What Happened**:
- I described the problem to Palette
- Palette classified it as:
  - **RIU-47** (Training & Enablement) — teaching agentic concepts
  - **RIU-89** (Agentic Orchestration) — demonstrating multi-agent workflows

**Why This Matters**:
- Palette has 105 validated problem-solution pairs (RIUs)
- Each RIU maps to proven solutions and agent archetypes
- Classification routes the problem to the right agents

**Glean Parallel**: When a customer says "I want AI to help sales reps close deals faster," you need to classify the problem (sales enablement? proposal generation? competitive intel?) before designing a solution.

---

## STEP 2: AGENT ROUTING (1 minute)

**What Happened**:
- Palette routed the problem to **Yutyrannus (Yuty)** — Narrative/GTM agent
- Yuty's job: Create a narrative structure and research directive

**Why Yuty**:
- This is a GTM/teaching problem (not a technical build problem)
- Yuty specializes in narrative structure, messaging, and enablement
- Yuty knows how to break down complex topics into teachable frameworks

**What Yuty Did**:
- Created a research directive for **Argentavis (Argy)** — Research agent
- Defined what Argy needed to research:
  - Top AI use cases (what problems are companies solving?)
  - Market validation (which use cases have funding and traction?)
  - Mapping to Palette RIUs (which RIUs are validated by the market?)

**Glean Parallel**: When working with a Glean customer, you need to route the problem to the right workflow (discovery → research → design → build → validate).

---

## STEP 3: RESEARCH (2 minutes)

**What Happened**:
- Argy researched 127 AI companies across 12 use cases
- Mapped them to Palette RIUs
- Validated which RIUs have market demand (funded companies = real problems)

**Key Findings**:
- **Top 3 hot use cases**: Sales ($2B+ funding), Customer Support ($700M+), Code Gen ($500M+)
- **Emerging category**: Agentic orchestration (15+ companies, 80% agentic-native)
- **Gap RIUs**: Decision logs, demo generation (services, not products)

**What This Proved**:
- Market validation: If venture-backed companies are building solutions, the problem is real
- Differentiation risk: 20+ companies in customer support = crowded market
- Category risk: 15+ companies in agentic orchestration = emerging category, less proven

**Glean Parallel**: When a customer says "I want AI for customer support," you need to research:
- What are similar companies doing?
- What's the market validation?
- What are the risks (differentiation, category, validation)?

---

## STEP 4: BUILD (2 minutes)

**What Happened**:
- **Therizinosaurus (Theri)** — Build agent created:
  - 30-minute demo script
  - 18-slide deck outline
  - 2 interview scenarios with answer frameworks
  - 4-Question Method framework (pattern, data, repetitive, measurable)

**Why Theri**:
- Theri specializes in building deliverables (scripts, decks, frameworks)
- Theri has access to the knowledge library (93 Q&A pairs) and taxonomy (105 RIUs)
- Theri knows how to structure content for teaching and enablement

**What Theri Built**:

**1. 4-Question Method Framework**:
- Is there a pattern?
- Is there data?
- Is it repetitive or high-volume?
- Can you measure success?

**2. Interview Scenario 1: Mature Market Assessment**
- Problem: Customer wants AI customer support chatbot
- Key Insight: 20+ companies, $700M+ = high validation
- Risk: Differentiation in crowded market
- MVP: Top 10 question types, human-in-the-loop
- Metrics: 85% accuracy (0-3 mo), 30% deflection (3-6 mo)

**3. Interview Scenario 2: Emerging Category Risk**
- Problem: Customer wants agentic workflow automation
- Key Insight: 15+ companies, $150M+ = emerging category
- Risk: Category validation + reliability
- MVP: ONE workflow, 3-5 tools, human-in-the-loop
- Metrics: 70% completion (0-3 mo), 50% time saved (3-6 mo)

**Glean Parallel**: When designing an AI agent for a Glean customer, you need to build:
- Agent workflow (input → retrieval → generation → human-in-the-loop)
- Success metrics (usage, efficiency, business outcomes)
- Pilot scope (12 weeks, 5-10 users, kill criteria)

---

## STEP 5: VALIDATION (1 minute)

**What Happened**:
- **Ankylosaurus (Anky)** — Validation agent checked:
  - Factual accuracy (does the output match the source data?)
  - Coherence (does the output make sense?)
  - Completeness (does the output answer the question?)

**Why Anky**:
- Anky specializes in quality validation
- Anky has access to the knowledge library and taxonomy
- Anky checks for hallucinations, inconsistencies, and gaps

**What Anky Found**:
- ✅ Factual accuracy: All company data and funding numbers are verifiable
- ✅ Coherence: Demo script flows logically, frameworks are clear
- ✅ Completeness: All interview scenarios have answer frameworks

**Glean Parallel**: When building an AI agent for a Glean customer, you need to validate:
- Accuracy (does the agent retrieve the right information?)
- Coherence (does the agent's output make sense?)
- Completeness (does the agent answer the user's question?)

---

## OUTCOME (1 minute)

**What Was Delivered**:
- Complete interview prep package in 20 minutes (vs. 4-6 hours manually)
- 30-minute demo script
- 18-slide deck outline
- 2 interview scenarios with answer frameworks
- 4-Question Method framework
- Market validation data (127 companies, 12 use cases)

**What This Proves**:
1. **Multi-agent workflow**: Yuty → Argy → Theri → Anky (not a single monolithic agent)
2. **Real outcome**: Used in a real interview (not a demo)
3. **Measurable efficiency**: 20 min vs. 4-6 hours (15X faster)
4. **Production-ready**: Has promotion/demotion logic (agents learn from success/failure)

**Glean Parallel**: When working with a Glean customer, you need to:
- Design multi-step workflows (discovery → research → design → build → validate)
- Ship real outcomes (not just demos)
- Measure efficiency (time saved, tasks completed, business results)
- Iterate based on feedback (usage data, customer satisfaction)

---

## KEY TAKEAWAYS (1 minute)

**What This Demonstrates**:

**3. I Can Design Agent Workflows for Customers**
- 4-Question Method (pattern, data, repetitive, measurable)
- Agent workflow design (input → retrieval → generation → human-in-the-loop)
- Pilot scoping (12 weeks, 5-10 users, success metrics, kill criteria)

**4. I Measure Outcomes**
- Time saved (20 min vs. 4-6 hours)
- Quality (factual accuracy, coherence, completeness)
- Production-readiness (promotion/demotion logic)

## CLOSING (30 seconds)

"This is exactly what I'd do with a Glean customer:
1. Classify the problem (what use case is this?)
2. Route to the right workflow (discovery → research → design → build → validate)
3. Design the agent (input → retrieval → generation → human-in-the-loop)
4. Scope a pilot (12 weeks, 5-10 users, clear success metrics)
5. Measure outcomes (usage, efficiency, business results)
6. Iterate based on feedback

That's how I ship AI outcomes, not just demos."

## IF THEY ASK: "HOW DOES PROMOTION/DEMOTION WORK?"

**Answer** (1 minute):

"Palette has three tiers:

**Tier 1: Core Prompt** (immutable rules, never changes)
- Defines how agents should behave
- Sets quality standards and safety guardrails

**Tier 2: Agents** (middle tier, tests problems against solutions)
- Each agent has a specific role (research, build, validate)
- Agents have access to knowledge library (93 Q&A pairs) and taxonomy (105 RIUs)

**Tier 3: Testing at Scale** (logs what works, enables learning)
- Every agent action is logged with success/failure
- Agents get promoted based on success rates:
  - UNVALIDATED → WORKING (after 10 successes)
  - WORKING → PRODUCTION (after 50 runs with <5% failure rate)
- Agents get demoted if they fail:
  - 2 failures within 10 runs → demoted to UNVALIDATED

**Why This Matters**:
- Agents learn from success and failure
- System auto-improves over time
- Bad agents get demoted, good agents get promoted
- This is production, not a demo"

---

## IF THEY ASK: "WHAT ARE THE 7 AGENT ARCHETYPES?"

**Answer** (1 minute):

"Palette has 7 agent archetypes, each with a specific role:

1. **Argentavis (Argy)** — Research agent
   - Gathers information, validates sources, maps to taxonomy

2. **Rex** — Architecture agent
   - Designs system architecture, defines workflows, sets standards

3. **Therizinosaurus (Theri)** — Build agent
   - Creates deliverables (scripts, decks, frameworks, code)

4. **Velociraptor (Raptor)** — Debug agent
   - Identifies issues, proposes fixes, validates solutions

5. **Yutyrannus (Yuty)** — Narrative/GTM agent
   - Creates narrative structure, messaging, enablement materials

6. **Ankylosaurus (Anky)** — Validation agent
   - Checks factual accuracy, coherence, completeness

7. **Parasaurolophus (Para)** — Monitoring agent
   - Tracks usage, measures outcomes, identifies trends

**Why These Archetypes**:
- Each agent has a specific role (not a general-purpose agent)
- Agents collaborate to solve complex problems
- Mirrors how real teams work (research → design → build → validate → monitor)"

---

## FINAL NOTE

**When to Use This Demo**:
- If they ask: "Tell me about a time you built an AI agent"
- If they ask: "How do you design multi-agent workflows?"
- If they ask: "Show me an example of AI outcomes you've shipped"

**When NOT to Use This Demo**:
- If they're short on time (save it for a follow-up)
- If they're more interested in customer-facing work (focus on AWS GTM instead)
- If they want to dive into Glean-specific use cases (pivot to demo scenario instead)
