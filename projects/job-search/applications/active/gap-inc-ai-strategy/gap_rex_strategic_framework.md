======================================================================
  REX STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK — GAP INC. AI STRATEGY
  Phase 2: Architecture & Strategy
======================================================================

**Date**: February 12, 2026
**Built by**: Rex (Architecture Agent)
**Based on**: 5 Argy research cycles + Mical's convergence brief

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Mission**: Build an Office of AI that enables Gap Inc.'s 10,000+ employees across 4 brands to use AI confidently — making people feel more valued as individuals, delivering faster and more complete work, with budget shrinking because we did it right.

**Approach**: Forward Deployed Engineer (FDE) model — embed AI experts with business units (stores, merchandising, supply chain, brands) to integrate AI onto existing infrastructure, not build platforms from scratch.

**Timeline**: 3-year phased approach
- Year 1: Build Office of AI (6 FDEs + 3-4 support), pilot with 2 brands
- Year 2: Scale to all 4 brands, cross-brand learning
- Year 3: Budget reduction (30-40% lower than Year 1)

**Investment**: $1.2M-$1.9M/year (35-40% cheaper than platform model)

**Expected ROI**: 15-20% efficiency gains Year 1, 25-30% Year 2, budget shrinks 30-40% Year 3

## 1. AI READINESS ASSESSMENT

### Where Gap Is Today (6 Dimensions)

**Dimension 1: Executive Commitment** ✅ STRONG
- CEO Richard Dickson's "digital-first organization and mindset"
- AI innovation unit established 2024
- Google Cloud partnership announced October 2025
- CTO Sven Gerjets (30+ years experience, reports to CEO)
- **Score**: 8/10

**Dimension 2: Technology Infrastructure** ⚠️ MODERATE
- Google Cloud partnership (Gemini, Vertex AI, BigQuery)
- 200+ existing AI models (consolidating into Gemini Enterprise)
- Legacy systems modernizing (order management, warehouse, POS)
- Unknown enterprise stack (Workday? ServiceNow? Salesforce?)
- **Score**: 6/10
- **Gap**: Need to discover actual enterprise software stack

**Dimension 3: Data Foundations** ⚠️ MODERATE
- BigQuery (data warehouse via Google Cloud)
- 200+ AI models (indicates data exists, but fragmented)
- No unified data foundation disclosed
- **Score**: 5/10
- **Gap**: Data unification critical (95% of GenAI pilots fail without this)

**Dimension 4: AI Talent & Skills** ❌ WEAK
- AI innovation unit exists (size/structure unknown)
- No Office of AI
- No AI leadership role (Mical's role is new)
- No FDE model or embedded AI teams
- **Score**: 3/10
- **Gap**: Need to build Office of AI from scratch

**Dimension 5: Governance & Risk Management** ❌ WEAK
- No public disclosure of AI governance
- No risk frameworks
- No brand safety protocols
- No compliance approach disclosed
- **Score**: 2/10
- **Gap**: Establish AI Governance Committee, risk frameworks, brand safety

**Dimension 6: Organizational Readiness** ⚠️ MODERATE
- "Embedding AI experimentation into company culture"
- Employees adopting AI tools for storytelling, planning, design
- Still in experimentation phase (not scaled to operations)
- **Score**: 5/10
- **Gap**: Move from experimentation to scaled operations

---

### Overall AI Readiness: 4.8/10 (EARLY STAGE)

**Strengths**:
- Executive commitment (8/10)
- Technology infrastructure foundation (6/10)

**Weaknesses**:
- AI talent & skills (3/10)
- Governance & risk management (2/10)

**Opportunity**: Office of AI accelerates Gap from 4.8/10 (early) to 7/10 (moderate) in Year 1, 8.5/10 (advanced) by Year 3

---

## 2. USE CASE PRIORITIZATION MATRIX

### Scoring Framework (0-100 points)

**Business Impact** (0-30 points):
- Revenue impact or cost reduction in $ terms
- Number of employees affected
- Strategic alignment with CEO priorities

**Feasibility** (0-25 points):
- Data availability (does data exist?)
- Technical complexity (can we build on existing infra?)
- Team readiness (do we have skills?)

**Risk** (0-20 points, inverse):
- Brand safety risk (customer-facing = higher risk)
- Compliance risk (PII, CCPA, GDPR, PCI)
- Operational risk (what if it fails?)

**Time to Value** (0-15 points):
- Months to measurable impact
- Faster = higher score

**Strategic Alignment** (0-10 points):
- Fits brand strategy and enterprise AI vision
- Aligns with "AI as amplification, not replacement"

## 3. PLATFORM DECISION FRAMEWORK

### Build vs Buy Analysis

**Option 1: Build Custom Platform** ❌ NOT RECOMMENDED
- Cost: $2M-$3M Year 1 (platform build)
- Timeline: 12-18 months to production
- Risk: High (95% of custom AI platforms fail)
- Maintenance: $500K-$800K/year ongoing
- **Verdict**: Too expensive, too slow, too risky

**Option 2: Buy Best-of-Breed Tools** ❌ NOT RECOMMENDED
- Cost: $2M-$5M/year (100 tools × $20K-$50K each)
- Complexity: 100 integrations, 100 training programs
- Maintenance: $1M-$2M/year (tool sprawl)
- **Verdict**: Tool sprawl, no unified experience

**Option 3: Leverage Google Cloud Partnership** ✅ RECOMMENDED
- Cost: $500K-$800K/year (Gemini Enterprise + Vertex AI + BigQuery)
- Timeline: 3-6 months to first pilot (leverage existing partnership)
- Risk: Low (Google Cloud proven at scale)
- Maintenance: Included in partnership
- **Verdict**: Best fit for Gap's current state

## 5. PILOT-TO-SCALE PLAYBOOK

### 5-Phase Methodology

**Phase 1: Hypothesis (Week 1-2)**
- Define problem statement (specific to brand/business unit)
- Identify success metrics (quantified, measurable)
- Map baseline behavior (pre-AI performance)
- Estimate ROI (conservative, risk-adjusted)
- Get executive sponsorship (brand leader approval)

**Phase 2: Pilot (Week 3-8)**
- Build on existing infrastructure (no new platforms)
- Test with 5-10 users (early adopters)
- Iterate daily (rapid feedback loops)
- Measure behavior change (not just adoption)
- Document learnings (what worked, what didn't)

**Phase 3: Measure (Week 9-10)**
- Compare to baseline (pre-AI vs post-AI)
- Quantify ROI (actual vs estimated)
- Identify failure modes (what went wrong)
- Validate with Anky (is this the best we know?)
- Decision: Kill, Iterate, or Scale

**Phase 4: Scale (Week 11-16)**
- Roll out to 50-100 users (pilot scale)
- Train champions (peer adoption, not top-down)
- Monitor usage (dashboard use as KPI)
- Support in real-time (FDE embedded)
- Measure business outcomes (cost reduction, productivity)

**Phase 5: Operationalize (Week 17+)**
- Hand off to business unit (self-sufficiency)
- Document for cross-brand replication
- Feed insights back to Office of AI
- Continuous improvement (monitor, iterate)

---

### Kill Criteria (When to Stop)

**Kill if**:
- No measurable improvement after 8 weeks
- Behavior change not happening (employees not using it)
- ROI negative or unclear
- Risk too high (brand safety, compliance)
- Business unit not engaged (no executive sponsor)

**Mical's "No" Framework**: Kill bad ideas before they waste budget
