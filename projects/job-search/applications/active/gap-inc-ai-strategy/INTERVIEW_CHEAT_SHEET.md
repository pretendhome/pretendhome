# GAP AI STRATEGY — INTERVIEW CHEAT SHEET

---

## AWS ANCHOR STORY — "FROM BROADCAST TO BEHAVIOR CHANGE"

*Lead with this. It proves you've already done this kind of transformation.*

### Problem at AWS

Enablement was broadcast and fragmented:
- Static HQ pages, mass emails, broad sessions
- Multiple tools (QuickSuite, Kiro, internal research) with no coherent path
- Sellers labeled "not technical enough" or "not adapting"

Meanwhile:
- Comp tied to precise form submissions
- Sales plays required narrative rehearsal
- New products launched weekly
- AI tools existed but were intimidating

**The gap wasn't technology — it was confidence, clarity, and relevance.**

### What You Did (5 Moves)

**1. Started With Sellers, Not Tools**
- Met PMs and field leaders to map SPIFs, comp rules, required forms, GEO/POD motions
- Built enablement aligned to their incentives:
  - "Use AI to fill this form correctly so you get paid"
  - "Use AI to rehearse this sales play before the call"
  - "Use AI to generate a pitch narrative tailored to this motion"

> **Bridge to Gap**: "At Gap, I'd start the same way: with merchandisers, planners, and store managers, mapping their incentives and workflows before prescribing any tools."

**2. Built Agentic Workflows for Yourself First**
- Automated your own reporting pipeline
- Built GEO + Job Title + Sales Play analytics views
- Set up retrieval flows to generate contextual enablement summaries
- Used research agents to audit relevance and citation quality
- Identified bias in outputs and tuned retrieval/vector strategy
- Never asked sellers to adopt workflows you hadn't battle-tested yourself

**3. Reduced Fear With 5-Minute Recipes**
- Short, practical workflows: "Generate a sales play narrative in 5 minutes," "Audit your form submission," "Use Kiro to rehearse a pitch"
- Live, copyable workflows instead of theory
- Turned AI from abstract concept into usable behavior

**4. Moved From Mass Promotion to Targeted Activation**
- No more "blast everyone"
- Targeted specific PODs and roles
- Custom Slack channels and tailored content
- Each group got the one thing that unlocked them

**5. Reframed Executive Perception**
- Pushback narrative: "Sellers don't know how to sell when it's not easy"
- Your view: intelligent operators trapped in fragmented systems, incentives misaligned, fear of AI with no safe practice
- You humanized adoption: live demos, cross-org meetings, assuming high intelligence, removing stigma

### Impact (Hard Numbers)

- **+17% attendance** (153 → 179 per session)
- **+50% high-CSAT sessions** (>4.9)
- **+67% sales plays covered** (133 → 222)
- Distribution moved to Zoom webinar; calendar holds removed
- Interactive HQ navigation and automated analytics pipeline built

**Most important behavior shift**:
Sellers stopped asking "What is this tool?" and started asking **"Can this help me win this deal?"**
That's behavior change, not just usage.

### Why This Maps Directly to Gap

- Enable non-technical users (sellers) to adopt AI confidently
- Design agentic workflows you run in production before evangelizing
- Tie AI to real incentives (compensation, deal success), not abstract adoption
- Shift from broadcast enablement to targeted activation
- Change executive narrative from "people problem" to "system and incentive problem"

> **Closing line**: "At AWS I took fragmented, top-down enablement and turned it into targeted, agentic workflows that sellers actually used. At Gap, I'd do the same for merchandisers and store associates — but now the stakes are inventory, margin, and customer experience instead of cloud deals."

## THE PROBLEM (GAP)

- **$50M-$100M/year** operational waste (overstock, markdowns, manual tasks)
- **~200 AI models** and tools creating tool sprawl, no coherent system
- **60-70%** of store associate time on tasks, not customers
- Forecasting and pricing still driven by intuition instead of integrated, data-driven decisions

## ONE-SENTENCE SOLUTION

One agentic system that makes every employee more capable at their specific job — not 100 tools, not pure automation, not replacing people.

## KEY NUMBERS (3-YEAR VIEW)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| 3-Year Investment | $7.2M-$7.8M |
| 3-Year Benefit | $37.9M-$65M |
| 3-Year ROI | 430-730% |
| Year 1 Ask | $1.6M-$1.7M |
| Year 1 ROI | 120-280% |
| Payback | < 1 month after go-live |
| Year 3 Budget | 25-30% lower than Year 2 |

## 5 BIG IDEAS

### 1. FDE Model, Not "AI Platform Project"

Embed Forward-Deployed Engineers directly with business units (Old Navy, Gap, Banana Republic, Athleta). Palantir, Databricks, Accenture's ~30K FDEs all use this. 12-week pilots instead of 12-month platform builds. FDEs sit WITH the operators they serve; they don't throw tools over the wall.

> "Instead of building a huge 'AI platform' and hoping people come, we start by putting a small team directly inside merchandising and stores, and build what those people actually use within 12 weeks."

### 2. LVMH-Style Governance (Central + Brand Autonomy)

Central: one secure AI platform, policies, observability, shared models and agents. Federated: each brand decides which use cases to prioritize and owns adoption. LVMH does this at 75 maisons with MaIA (~40K employees, 2M+ requests/month); Gap has 4 brands, so it's easier to coordinate.

> "LVMH runs a single internal assistant, MaIA, across 75 maisons. Gap has four brands. A similar hub-and-spoke model here is not only possible, it's simpler."

### 3. Operations-First, Brand-Safe

Year 1: operations and internal tools. Year 2: scale across brands. Year 3: selectively customer-facing where risk is low and value proven. Avoid Amazon Just Walk Out (heavy human back office) and food chain voice AI (viral failures).

> "We start where the ROI is clear and brand risk is low — back-of-house and associates — and earn the right to go customer-facing later."

### 4. Behavior Change, Not Training Events

5-minute recipes, not 2-hour workshops. Champions program (POD-level advocates) instead of forcing tools. Persona-specific UX: mobile-first for associates, desktop for buyers/merchandisers. Shadow AI usage as a demand signal, not something to punish.

> "The constraint isn't intelligence, it's hesitation. You fix that with short, repeatable workflows tied to their actual incentives, not with another mandatory training."

### 5. Budget Shrinks Because Tool Sprawl Dies

Year 1: targeted investment to prove value. Year 2: scale successful patterns. Year 3: sunset overlapping tools, consolidate into one coherent system.

> "By Year 3 the budget is 25-30% lower than Year 2, because we're deleting overlapping tools. We don't ask for more money every year; we reduce spend because the system is working."

## YEAR 1 PILOTS (CONCRETE PLAN)

**Old Navy — Inventory Forecasting**
~$50K | 5-10 merchandisers, 100-200 SKUs | Goal: 15-20% forecast accuracy improvement | Benefit: ~$2-3M

**Gap — Store Associate AI Assistant**
~$75K | 5-10 stores, 50-100 associates | Mobile + voice (inventory, product info, policies) | Benefit: ~$1.75-3.5M

**Banana Republic — Markdown Optimization**
~$60K | 5-10 merchandisers, key assortments | Price elasticity modeling + coordinated markdowns | Benefit: ~$1.75-3.5M

**Rule**: All pilots are 12 weeks, with explicit kill criteria.

## 5 RISKS & MITIGATIONS

1. **Brand safety** — stay operations-first Year 1, no direct customer automation
2. **Operational** — human-in-the-loop, live A/B tests, instant rollback
3. **Compliance** — PII triage, privacy-by-design, audit trails
4. **Employee trust** — "amplification, not replacement," safe practice spaces, champions
5. **Financial** — phased funding, 12-week kill switch, conservative benefit estimates

## RETAIL COMPARABLES

- **Walmart**: major AI/logistics initiatives delivering large-scale savings and productivity gains
- **Zara**: legendary inventory + fast fashion; high full-price sell-through by tight data loop
- **Perry Ellis**: dramatic SKU launch time reduction with AI-assisted processes
- **LVMH**: MaIA shows one internal assistant can support ~40K employees across 75 brands

> "We're aiming for LVMH-style internal adoption at a company with a fraction of the complexity, and Walmart-style operational savings at about one sixty-fifth of their AI spend."

---

## "NO" FRAMEWORK

**Kill pilots after 12 weeks if**: no measurable improvement | DAU/WAU < 80% | realized ROI < 50% of projected | unmitigated risk appears | business unit leaders not engaged

**Explicitly say no to**: AI replacing employees | black-box models controlling prices or staffing | forced adoption | a dozen disconnected tools and vendor hype

## 3 OUT-OF-THE-BOX IDEAS (DIFFERENTIATORS)

### 1. Seams Theory — Where the $50-100M Waste Comes From

Not a people problem; it's a seams problem between teams and systems. Forecasting, markdown, supply, and stores optimize individually. No one agent sees end-to-end: demand → buy → allocate → markdown → replenishment.

**Anchor scenario**: "Old Navy store #247 has 200 extra units of a jacket. Today, forecasting, markdown, and replenishment react separately. By the time everything syncs, margin is gone. One agentic system can simultaneously: mark down 15% in that store, reduce the next buy by 30%, and reroute inbound units to the store that's selling out — one decision, coordinated."

**Layer 1**: this level of coordination is impossible without AI at Gap's scale.

### 2. Staffing Inversion — 2 People Doing What 5 Couldn't

Not arguing to cut heads. Arguing to invert what the same heads can do. From "ring transactions and tidy shelves" to:
- "We can see every nearby store's inventory in real time"
- "We can recognize a returning customer and pull things they're likely to love"
- "We can notice a micro-trend (rain jackets) and trigger a floor set shift"

> "The question isn't 'can we run stores with fewer people?' It's 'what new capabilities do those same people have when an assistant shows them cross-store inventory, demand signals, and next best actions in real time?'"

### 3. Data That Doesn't Exist Yet

Biggest forecasting gains don't come from re-analyzing old data; they come from data you don't have yet:
- TikTok/Instagram trend velocity 4-6 weeks before POS
- Micro-demand by weather and local events
- Cross-brand cannibalization (Old Navy vs Gap vs Athleta)
- Structured return reasons (fit, quality, expectation mismatch)
- Foot-traffic intent: not just counts, but what people looked at and walked away from

> "Everyone is trying to squeeze more out of yesterday's data. The real advantage is in creating new information streams Gap doesn't have today — intent, cross-brand cannibalization, micro-trends — and feeding them into the same system."

---

## TWO-LAYER FRAMEWORK

**Layer 1 — Impossible Without AI**
- Cross-system coordination (seams theory)
- Real-time cross-store and cross-brand views
- Trend velocity detection
- Cannibalization and intent detection

**Layer 2 — Augment Humans**
- More time with customers
- Faster, more confident decisions
- Better merch and pricing choices
- Champions teaching peers

---

## CLOSING LINE

"We're not building AI for AI's sake. We're making 10,000+ Gap employees more capable at their specific jobs. The budget shrinks because we did it right."
