1️⃣ How would you prioritize AI use cases across merchandising, HR, supply chain, and stores?

Executive Answer:

I prioritize using three lenses: measurable business impact, workflow integration feasibility, and risk profile.

First, I look for areas with clear economic signals — margin, inventory accuracy, markdown optimization, or time spent on repetitive tasks.

Second, I assess whether the AI can embed directly into existing workflows. If it requires behavior change without integration, adoption will stall.

Third, I evaluate brand, compliance, and operational risk. In Year 1, I focus on internal use cases where ROI is measurable and exposure is low.

I believe in proving value through tightly scoped pilots with explicit success metrics before scaling.

2️⃣ What would your first 90 days look like?

Executive Answer:

Days 1–30: Diagnose. Map stakeholders, tool sprawl, data readiness, and workflow friction.

Days 30–60: Prioritize. Identify two to three pilots with measurable KPIs and clear ownership.

Days 60–90: Execute disciplined pilots with feedback loops and executive visibility.

The goal isn’t scale in 90 days — it’s clarity, alignment, and one tangible proof point that the operating model works.

3️⃣ How do you ensure responsible, human-centered AI enablement?

Executive Answer:

Responsible AI starts with scope discipline. Not every workflow should be automated.

I design for augmentation over replacement, embed human-in-the-loop controls, establish clear data boundaries, and measure performance transparently.

Trust is a design constraint. When employees understand what the system can and cannot do, adoption accelerates.

4️⃣ How do you measure ROI for enterprise AI initiatives?

Executive Answer:

I measure ROI across three categories: cost reduction, productivity lift, and revenue or margin impact.

For operational use cases, that might mean reduced manual time or improved forecast accuracy. For merchandising, improved sell-through or reduced markdown intensity.

I always define baseline metrics before launching pilots and track realized impact, not theoretical gains.

ROI should be visible, measurable, and tied to business KPIs — not just usage metrics.

5️⃣ How do you handle executive pushback on AI investment?

Executive Answer:

I frame AI investment as a portfolio decision, not a moonshot.

Start small. Define measurable outcomes. Fund in phases.

If the pilot doesn’t hit predefined thresholds, we stop. If it does, we scale.

That discipline reduces risk and builds executive confidence.

6️⃣ How do you prevent tool sprawl?

Executive Answer:

Tool sprawl happens when experimentation isn’t governed.

I recommend a centralized platform strategy with federated use-case ownership.

That means shared standards, observability, and security — but brand-level autonomy in prioritization.

We sunset overlapping tools as successful patterns emerge.

7️⃣ How do you drive AI adoption among non-technical employees?

Executive Answer:

Adoption succeeds when AI is embedded into existing workflows and tied to incentives.

I focus on small, practical workflows — not large training sessions.

Champions at the team level are critical. When peers demonstrate value, adoption spreads organically.

8️⃣ When should you NOT use AI?

Executive Answer:

When the workflow lacks clean data, when risk outweighs value, or when automation removes necessary human judgment.

AI should solve meaningful problems, not create novelty.

If a deterministic system works better, use it.

9️⃣ How would you evaluate ChatGPT vs Copilot vs Claude for enterprise use?

Executive Answer:

I evaluate across four dimensions: capability, integration into existing enterprise systems, governance and compliance, and cost structure.

The right platform depends on workflow fit and ecosystem integration — not model hype.

Platform choice should follow operating model strategy.

🔟 How do you balance centralization vs brand autonomy?

Executive Answer:

Centralize standards, security, and core platform infrastructure.

Federate use-case prioritization and adoption within brands.

This allows scale without suppressing brand differentiation.

11️⃣ What are the biggest risks of AI in retail?

Executive Answer:

Brand safety, pricing errors, biased decision-making, and over-automation.

Retail margins are tight — small errors scale quickly.

Risk management and guardrails must precede scale.

12️⃣ How do you embed AI into Workday or HR systems?

Executive Answer:

Start with employee-facing workflows — onboarding support, policy Q&A, learning recommendations.

Integrate via APIs, maintain clear data boundaries, and avoid creating shadow systems.

AI should enhance the system of record, not replace it.

13️⃣ How do you ensure AI improves margin, not just productivity?

Executive Answer:

Tie AI directly to margin-linked KPIs — sell-through rate, markdown percentage, inventory turns.

If the use case doesn’t connect to economic drivers, it shouldn’t be prioritized.

14️⃣ How do you scale from pilot to enterprise rollout?

Executive Answer:

Define success upfront. Measure impact. Document lessons.

Standardize governance and rollout playbooks.

Then scale deliberately — not emotionally.

15️⃣ How do you handle resistance from middle management?

Executive Answer:

Resistance often reflects fear of loss of control.

I involve managers early, define success metrics collaboratively, and show how AI supports their team’s performance.

Ownership reduces resistance.

16️⃣ What does “AI enablement” mean to you?

Executive Answer:

It means making employees more capable at their specific jobs.

Not more tools. Not automation for its own sake.

Capability amplification.

17️⃣ How do you prioritize across competing stakeholder demands?

Executive Answer:

Use a transparent scoring framework: impact, feasibility, risk, and data readiness.

Publish criteria. Make trade-offs visible.

That builds trust in prioritization decisions.

18️⃣ How do you monitor AI system performance over time?

Executive Answer:

Track model performance metrics, usage trends, business impact metrics, and drift indicators.

AI isn’t “launch and forget.” It’s monitor and iterate.

19️⃣ How do you manage vendor relationships?

Executive Answer:

Avoid single-vendor dependence when possible.

Negotiate flexibility, ensure data portability, and align contracts to performance.

Vendor strategy should support long-term operating flexibility.

20️⃣ What differentiates you from other AI strategists?

Executive Answer:

I’ve built and debugged production AI systems inside large enterprises.

I understand not just strategy, but adoption, governance, and real-world friction.

I design operating models that make AI usable — not just impressive.
