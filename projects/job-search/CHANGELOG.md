## Notes

### What's Working
- Fit assessment is filtering out poor fits (saved time on AI4I, Rime, Bobsled)
- Tailored resumes and cover letters (Glean, Gap Inc materials are strong)
- Interview prep is systematic (Glean prep took 2 hours, very thorough)

### What to Improve
- Need to increase application volume (target 3-5 per week, currently 2-3)
- Need to proactively research target companies (not just reactive to job posts)
- Need to build networking pipeline (referrals increase success rate)

### Adjustments
- Focus on Tier 1 and Tier 2 only (don't waste time on Tier 3 unless slow week)
- Set aside 2 hours per week for proactive company research
- Reach out to 3 contacts per week for referrals
