# KIRO PROMPT: MQ × TIE ONE DROP PODCAST PLANNING

---

## CONTEXT

You are planning a podcast for **Rossi Mission** (791 Valencia Street, San Francisco) — a nonprofit graffiti artist gallery. Rossi is launching its first artist drop: a tribute collection by NYC graffiti legend **MQ** (MKUE/MQUE) honoring **Tie One** (Jonathan See Lim, 1979–1998), a Bay Area graffiti writer shot and killed at age 18 in San Francisco's Tenderloin while painting.

**The Drop**: 8-SKU limited collection (tees, hoodie, hats, long sleeve, tote, sticker packs) — $10 to $95. Gallery opening + online Shopify drop + 2-week exhibition. Target revenue: $33K (moderate scenario). March 21 target date (near March 18 anniversary of Tie One's death).

**The Story**: MQ has been creating Tie One tribute art for years — stickers, merch, memorial pieces — without monetization. This is the first time that tribute practice enters a gallery, and it's happening in Tie One's city. The narrative is brotherhood-led with a justice context: Tie One was 18, unarmed, Filipino-American, and his shooter was exonerated.

**The 8-Week Buildup**: Rossi has a structured narrative arc — seed (curiosity), story (empathy), reveal (connection), build (anticipation), drop (catharsis), echo (resolution). The podcast should fit within and amplify this arc.

**Audience Segments**:
1. Graffiti/street culture community (core — must hear about this from within the culture first)
2. Art collectors (gallery crossover, MQ's credentials)
3. Streetwear/fashion buyers (limited drops, hype)
4. Social justice / Asian-American community (Tie One's story)

**Cultural Sensitivity Rules**:
- GREEN: Emphasize Tie One's full humanity, artistry, the authentic tribute tradition, community
- YELLOW: Don't focus on violence itself, don't claim "Tie One would have wanted this"
- RED: Never use crime scene imagery, never sensationalize racial elements, never speak for the family without permission

## TASK

Plan a podcast series for the MQ × Tie One drop. Deliver three things:

### 1. PLATFORM RECOMMENDATION

Evaluate and recommend the best platform strategy. Consider these options and any others you think fit:

- **Instagram Live** — Rossi's primary channel, real-time engagement, ephemeral but saveable. Audience is already here.
- **Instagram Live Podcast format** (saved to Reels/feed) — combines live energy with permanent content.
- **YouTube podcast** (video) — searchable, embeddable, permanent. Graffiti documentaries live here.
- **Riverside.fm / Zencastr** (record remotely, distribute everywhere) — professional quality, multi-platform distribution.
- **Spotify / Apple Podcasts** (audio-only) — traditional podcast, discoverable, but requires building audience from scratch.
- **TikTok Live** — younger audience, streetwear segment, but less depth for storytelling.
- **Hybrid approach** — record high-quality video, then distribute as: YouTube full episode + Spotify/Apple audio + Instagram Reels clips (60-90 sec) + TikTok clips.

For each option, evaluate: audience reach for our 4 segments, production complexity, cost, permanence, and fit with the 8-week narrative arc.

**Recommend ONE primary strategy** with reasoning. Consider that Rossi is a small nonprofit with limited production budget — whatever you recommend must be executable with minimal equipment (phone + mic + good lighting is the ceiling).

### 2. QUESTION LIST

Create a question list for the podcast. Organize by episode if you recommend a series, or by segment if single episode. Questions should:

- Draw out the STORY (not just facts — make it feel like a conversation between people who care about this culture)
- Cover: MQ's background, the Tie One story, the tribute practice, why now, the drop itself, the justice angle, graffiti culture's memorial traditions, what this means for Rossi Mission
- Include questions for different potential guests:
  - **MQ** (primary guest — the artist)
  - **Rossi Mission founder/team** (the gallery, the mission, why this drop)
  - **Someone from the graffiti community** (cultural context, Tie One's legacy, crew connections)
  - **Optional: Tie One's family or friends** (only if they consent and want to participate — never pressure)
- Include "bridge" questions that naturally lead to awareness of the drop without sounding like a sales pitch
- Include questions that would generate clips (short, powerful moments for Reels/TikTok)

### 3. ROLLOUT & PROMOTION STRATEGY

Map the podcast to the 8-week narrative arc. Specifically:

- **When** should each episode (or the single episode) drop relative to T-0 (gallery opening)?
- **How** does the podcast feed the existing marketing channels (Instagram, email, press, graffiti forums)?
- **What clips** get cut from each episode and where do they go?
- **How** do you promote the podcast itself? (Cross-promotion, graffiti forum posts, press mentions, email teasers)
- **What's the call-to-action** at the end of each episode? (RSVP, email signup, shop link, follow)
- **How** does the podcast continue AFTER the drop? (Recap episode, community response, future drops)

Also consider:
- Should MQ appear on the podcast remotely (he's in NYC) or in person (if he comes early)?
- Should there be a LIVE episode at the gallery opening itself?
- How does this podcast become a recurring Rossi asset (not just a one-off for this drop)?

## DELIVERABLES

1. **Platform recommendation** (1 primary + distribution plan, with cost estimate)
2. **Episode structure** (how many episodes, length, format, release schedule)
3. **Full question list** (organized by guest and episode, 40-60 questions total)
4. **Clip strategy** (10-15 potential clip moments with platform destination)
5. **Rollout calendar** (mapped to the 8-week timeline)
6. **Promotion plan** (how to get listeners — channel by channel)
7. **Post-drop continuation** (how the podcast becomes a Rossi property beyond this drop)

## CONSTRAINTS

- Budget: minimal — phone recording quality is fine, but recommend one upgrade if it's worth it (e.g., a $50-100 USB mic)
- Timeline: must fit within the 8-week pre-drop buildup
- Cultural sensitivity: follow the GREEN/YELLOW/RED framework above at all times
- Graffiti community first: they must feel this is authentic, not corporate. The podcast tone should be conversational, not polished. Think: two friends talking in a gallery after hours, not a branded content studio.
- This is Rossi's first podcast — it should be designed so it can become a recurring series for future drops and artist features
