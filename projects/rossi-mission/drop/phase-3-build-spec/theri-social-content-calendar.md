**Agent**: Therizinosaurus (Theri) | **Phase**: 3 — Build Spec | **Date**: 2026-02-11

---

## Overview

8-week content calendar across Instagram (primary), TikTok (secondary), and cross-posts. 35+ posts mapped to the narrative arc: Seed → Story → Reveal → Urgency → Drop → Echo → Close. Each post includes caption, hashtags, image/video requirements, platform, and timing.

---

## 1. Hashtag Strategy

### Primary Hashtags (Every Post)
`#MQxTieOne` `#RossiMission` `#791Valencia`

### Secondary Hashtags (Rotate)
`#TieOneRIP` `#MQ` `#MKUE` `#MQUE` `#MQism` `#DMS` `#NYCGraffiti` `#SFGraffiti` `#GraffitiArt` `#StreetArt` `#LimitedDrop` `#TributeArt`

### Context Hashtags (Use Selectively)
`#AsianAmericanArt` `#FilipinArt` `#GraffitiCulture` `#NYHC` `#MissionDistrict` `#SanFrancisco`

### Platform Notes
- **Instagram**: 15-20 hashtags per post (mix primary + secondary + context)
- **TikTok**: 3-5 hashtags maximum
- **Do NOT use**: `#RIP` alone (too generic), `#StreetArtForSale` (diminishes the art)
