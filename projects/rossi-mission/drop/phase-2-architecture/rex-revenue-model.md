## 3-Stage Reasoning

### Stage 1: Gradient Descent (Revenue Maximization)
Maximize ASP × volume. Fewer SKUs at higher prices. Target collectors only. Potential: $50K-$80K gross from 30-50 transactions.

### Stage 2: Game Theory (Stakeholder Balance)
MQ needs to sell enough accessible items to maintain graffiti community credibility. Rossi needs revenue that contributes to the $500K retail Year 1 target. The drop must prove the model works for future artist drops. Over-pricing kills repeat potential; under-pricing leaves money on the table.

### Stage 3: Integration
Build three scenarios (conservative, moderate, aggressive) around a balanced product mix. Use the Basquiat/Keith Haring price ladder model: accessible entry ($10) through premium originals ($2,500). Optimize for **sellout at moderate scenario** — better to sell out and build demand than to sit on inventory.

### Product Mix Analysis
- **Entry tier** (stickers, pins, zine): 700 units, 55% of inventory, 16% of revenue
- **Mid tier** (tees, hoodie, hat, open print): 525 units, 42% of inventory, 48% of revenue
- **Premium tier** (limited print, originals): 39 units, 3% of inventory, 37% of revenue

This follows the proven drop pattern: majority of units at entry/mid, majority of revenue from mid/premium.

## 2. Three Revenue Scenarios

### Scenario A: Conservative (60% Sellthrough)

Assumes first-drop realities: limited audience, unproven model, some items don't move.

| Product | Units Sold | Revenue |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| Sticker pack | 290 | $2,900 |

## 4. Break-Even Analysis

### Fixed Costs (Must Spend Regardless)
| Cost | Amount |
|------|--------|
| COGS (all products produced) | $11,490 |
| Event (opening night) | $3,000 |
| MQ travel + accommodation | $1,300 |
| Photography | $400 |
| Marketing (social ads, printing) | $500 |
| **Total fixed** | **$16,690** |

### Break-Even Point
At an average unit price of ~$50 and average COGS of ~$9/unit:
- **Break-even units**: $16,690 / ($50 - $9) = **407 units**
- **Break-even as % of inventory**: 407 / 1,264 = **32%**

**The drop breaks even at just 32% sellthrough.** This is very favorable risk/reward — even a mediocre execution covers costs.

If we consider only the items that must be produced upfront (excluding items that could be print-on-demand):
- **Minimum upfront investment**: ~$8,000 (tees, hoodies, hats, prints, zines, stickers, pins)
- **Break-even at minimum**: ~195 units (~15% of total inventory)

## 5. Integration with Rossi Business Plan

### Year 1 Revenue Target Context
| Stream | Target | MQ x Tie One Contribution |
|--------|--------|--------------------------|
| Retail sales | $500,000 | $34K-$62K (7-12%) |
| Workshops | $80,000 | $0 (unless MQ does a workshop) |
| Events | $60,000 | $0-$2K (opening ticket potential) |
| Collaborations | $40,000 | Could count here if structured as collab |
| **Total Year 1** | **$780,000** | **$34K-$62K (4-8%)** |

### Strategic Value Beyond Revenue
Even at the conservative scenario ($34K), this drop delivers:
1. **Proof of concept**: Demonstrates the drop model works for Rossi
2. **Email list**: 500-2,000 new email subscribers from signup campaign
3. **Press coverage**: Establishes Rossi in art/streetwear press
4. **Artist pipeline signal**: Other artists see MQ's drop and want to work with Rossi
5. **Community credibility**: First drop success builds reputation
6. **Repeat potential**: If it sells out, Drop 2 (different artist or MQ follow-up) has built-in demand

### Revenue Per Square Foot
Rossi at 791 Valencia: assuming ~1,500 sq ft retail space
- **Drop revenue per sq ft**: $22-$42 (during drop period)
- **Annualized equivalent**: $572-$1,092/sq ft (if running drops monthly)
- **Retail industry benchmark**: $300-$600/sq ft for specialty retail

The drop model, if repeatable, could exceed standard retail per-square-foot metrics.

## 6. Production Considerations

### Lead Times
| Product | Production Method | Lead Time | Minimum Order |
|---------|------------------|-----------|---------------|
| Sticker packs | Custom vinyl printing | 2-3 weeks | 100 |
| Enamel pins | Custom manufacturer | 4-6 weeks | 100 |
| Zines | Short-run digital print | 1-2 weeks | 50 |
| Graphic tees | Screen print on blanks | 2-3 weeks | 24/design |
| Hoodies | Screen print on blanks | 2-3 weeks | 24 |
| Hats | Embroidered/printed | 3-4 weeks | 24 |
| Open prints | Giclée or screen | 1-2 weeks | No minimum |
| Limited prints | Giclée on fine art paper | 1-2 weeks | No minimum |
| Originals | MQ creates | 2-4 weeks | N/A |

**Critical path**: Enamel pins (4-6 weeks) and originals (MQ's studio time) are the longest lead items. Must be ordered/commissioned 6+ weeks before drop date.

### COGS Breakdown Assumptions
- Blank tees: $6-$8 (Bella+Canvas or similar quality)
- Screen printing (2 colors): $5-$6/unit at 100 qty
- Blank hoodies: $16-$20
- Print + embroidery on hats: $8-$10/unit
- Giclée prints: $8-$12/unit depending on size
- Fine art paper prints (limited): $15-$25/unit
- Zine printing (24pg, saddle stitch): $3-$5/unit
- Sticker printing (vinyl, 5-up): $1-$2/pack
- Enamel pins: $3-$5/unit at 200 qty

## 7. ONE-WAY DOORS: Pricing and Edition Sizes

### Edition Sizes
Once production is ordered, edition sizes are locked. Over-producing creates dead inventory; under-producing leaves revenue on the table.

**Recommendation**: Production quantities in Section 1 are calibrated for 80% sellthrough at moderate scenario. This means ~250 unsold units in conservative scenario (mostly entry-level items that can be sold post-drop or used as promotional items).

### Pricing
Prices communicate brand positioning. Starting too low makes it impossible to raise later. Starting too high alienates the community.

**Recommendation**: Prices in Section 1 are positioned at upper Tier 3 / lower Tier 2, consistent with MQ's current market ($100-$500 originals at Village Works) plus a 20-40% narrative premium for the tribute collection context.

**Confirmation required before Phase 3.**
