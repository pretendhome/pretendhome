# Rex Architecture: Narrative Arc
**Agent**: Rex (Revenue Architect) | **Phase**: 2 — Architecture | **Date**: 2026-02-11

---

## 3-Stage Reasoning

### Stage 1: Gradient Descent (Optimize for Engagement)
The story has explosive elements: murder, racism, injustice, a 25-year brotherhood, art as rebellion. Pure engagement optimization says: lead with the violence, amplify the "Jackie Chan" quote, make it outrage-driven. This maximizes clicks and shares.

### Stage 2: Game Theory (Multi-Agent Dynamics)
But the stakeholders have conflicting narrative needs:
- **Graffiti community** wants respect, not spectacle. Sensationalizing Tie One's death would be a betrayal.
- **Tie One's family** may not want their son's murder turned into marketing copy.
- **MQ** wants to honor his friend, not exploit a tragedy.
- **Collectors** want cultural significance, not controversy.
- **Media** wants a hook, but the hook must be authentic.

Leading with violence optimizes for one metric (attention) while destroying trust with every stakeholder that matters long-term.

### Stage 3: Integration
The optimal narrative leads with **the art and the brotherhood**, contextualizes the injustice, and lets the audience discover the deeper story on their own terms. The 5-minute pitch test: anyone hearing this story should understand why this drop matters within 5 minutes, without feeling manipulated.

## 1. Core Narrative

### The One-Sentence Story
**"For 25 years, MQ has been keeping Tie One's art alive. Now, for the first time, that tribute becomes a collection."**

### The 5-Minute Version

In 1998, Jonathan See Lim — known as Tie One — was an 18-year-old graffiti writer in San Francisco. Filipino immigrant, raised Buddhist, already prolific across the Bay Area. On March 18, he was shot and killed on a fire escape in the Tenderloin while painting. He was unarmed. The shooter walked free.

MQ — a legendary NYC graffiti writer from the 1980s Manhattan scene, connected to DMS crew and New York Hardcore — had a bond with Tie One through the crews they shared. When Tie One died, MQ didn't make a statement. He made art. Stickers. Hundreds of them. Then thousands. Across New York, Tokyo, Paris, Berlin, Mexico City. For 25 years, MQ has been putting Tie One's name on walls and surfaces across the world.

Now, for the first time, MQ is bringing that 25-year tribute into a gallery. Not because anyone asked him to — because after a quarter century, it's time. The collection features original works, limited prints, and accessible items so anyone who connects with this story can take a piece of it home.

This is at Rossi Mission, 791 Valencia Street, San Francisco — the same city where Tie One lived, painted, and died.

### Why This Narrative Works
1. **Leads with the relationship** (brotherhood), not the violence
2. **Establishes MQ's credentials** (1980s NYC, legendary, global) without unverifiable claims
3. **Introduces Tie One's death as context**, not spectacle
4. **The 25-year timeline** is the emotional anchor — this isn't opportunistic
5. **"First time in a gallery"** creates event urgency without manufactured scarcity
6. **San Francisco location** ties it to Tie One's home turf

## 2. Narrative by Audience Segment

### Segment 1: Graffiti / Street Art Community

**Core message**: "MQ is doing right by Tie One. The culture's own, in a gallery on Tie One's turf."

**Tone**: Respectful, insider language, no explanation of who MQ or Tie One are (they know). Emphasis on the legitimacy of the tribute.

**Key phrases**:
- "25 years. MQ never stopped putting up for Tie."
- "DMS. BBB. The real ones know."
- "First time this work hits a gallery. 791 Valencia. Tie One's city."

**What NOT to say**:
- Don't explain graffiti culture to this audience
- Don't use the word "street art" (they say "graffiti" or "writing")
- Don't lead with pricing or products — lead with the tribute

**Content format**: Instagram posts from MQ's account, forum posts on 12ozProphet, word-of-mouth through crew networks

---

### Segment 2: Art Collectors

**Core message**: "A documented 1980s NYC graffiti artist with gallery representation creates a tribute collection rooted in a 25-year creative practice."

**Tone**: Professional, credentialed, investment-aware. Emphasize MQ's history, publications, gallery representation, and the cultural moment.

**Key phrases**:
- "MQ emerged from the same early 1980s Manhattan scene that produced the downtown art revolution"
- "Represented by Martinez Gallery, featured in Living Proof New York, i-D Magazine, and the Dr. Martens cultural series"
- "The tribute collection represents 25 years of creative practice — the earliest documented pieces date to 2000"
- "Limited editions, signed works, originals on paper"

**What NOT to say**:
- Don't claim MQ "painted alongside Keith Haring" (unverified — see argy-mq-credibility.md)
- Don't oversell market potential — let the work and story speak
- Don't compare MQ to Basquiat or Banksy in price terms

**Content format**: Art press pitches, gallery email blasts, Artsy listing, professional photography of works

### Segment 3: Streetwear / Hypebeast Culture

**Core message**: "Limited drop. NYC graffiti legend. SF gallery exclusive. When it's gone, it's gone."

**Tone**: Urgent, visual, scarcity-driven. Less story, more product + exclusivity.

**Key phrases**:
- "MQ x Tie One. Limited run."
- "NYC legend. DMS crew. 40+ years in the game."
- "Available at one gallery. Online for 2 weeks. Then it's done."
- "Stickers to originals. $10 to $3,000."

**What NOT to say**:
- Don't over-explain the backstory in the first touchpoint (they'll discover it)
- Don't use academic art language
- Don't make it feel like a charity project

**Content format**: Instagram reels (product shots, unboxing style), TikTok, Hypebeast/Highsnobiety features

---

### Segment 4: General Public / Media / Social Justice

**Core message**: "In 1998, an unarmed 18-year-old was killed for painting. The shooter called him 'Jackie Chan' and walked free. For 25 years, one artist has been keeping his memory alive."

**Tone**: Journalistic, emotional, justice-oriented. This is the segment where the full story lands hardest.

**Key phrases**:
- "Jonathan See Lim was 18 when he was shot on a fire escape in the Tenderloin"
- "The shooter told reporters: 'I had no idea this individual would play Jackie Chan'"
- "A grand jury exonerated the shooter. Tie One's community never forgot."
- "MQ has been creating tribute art for 25 years — stickers in Tokyo, Paris, Berlin, and every city in between"
- "Now, at 791 Valencia in San Francisco — Tie One's city — the tribute becomes a gallery exhibition"

**What to be careful about**:
- Frame as tribute, not exploitation
- Include Tie One's full humanity (Filipino immigrant, artist, Buddhist, 18 years old) — not just his death
- If Tie One's family is involved or has given blessing, say so prominently
- Don't use Tie One's death as clickbait — the 25-year tribute is the story

**Content format**: Long-form press pitch (SFGate, SF Chronicle, Mission Local), Asian-American media (NextShark), social justice publications, podcast pitches

## 3. Narrative Sequencing

### Phase-by-Phase Story Rollout

| Phase | Story Beat | Emotional Arc | Primary Audience |
|-------|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| **T-8 to T-6: Origin** | MQ's throwback art, hints at something coming | Curiosity | Graffiti community |
| **T-5 to T-4: Reveal** | "MQ x Tie One tribute at Rossi Mission" | Recognition | Graffiti + Collectors |
| **T-3: Legacy** | "Who was Tie One?" — full story | Empathy, anger, respect | All segments |
| **T-2: Brotherhood** | MQ tells his Tie One story (video/carousel) | Connection | All segments |
| **T-1: Product** | Product reveal, pricing, how to buy | Anticipation, FOMO | Streetwear + Collectors |
| **T-0: Event** | Gallery opening, MQ speaks, community gathers | Catharsis | In-person attendees |
| **T+1: Drop** | Online products live | Urgency | All segments |
| **T+2 to T+14: Echo** | Visitor reactions, remaining items, MQ reflections | Afterglow | All segments |
| **T+21: Close** | "Sold out. Thank you." | Resolution | All segments |

### The Emotional Arc
```
Curiosity → Recognition → Empathy → Connection → Anticipation → Catharsis → Urgency → Resolution
```

This mirrors the classic narrative structure. The audience goes on a journey from "what is this?" to "I need to be part of this."

## 4. Cultural Sensitivity Framework

### Red Lines (Never Cross)

1. **Never sensationalize the shooting details for marketing purposes**
   - The forensic details, the fire escape, the "please don't shoot" — these are part of the historical record. They should be available for those who seek them, but should not be the headline of a product pitch.

2. **Never use Tie One's death photo or crime scene imagery**
   - If any such imagery exists, it is absolutely off-limits for commercial use.

3. **Never claim Tie One would have "wanted this"**
   - We don't know what Tie One would have wanted. What we know is what MQ has been doing for 25 years.

4. **Never reduce Tie One to his death**
   - He was an artist, a son, a Buddhist, a Filipino immigrant, a member of multiple crews. He painted prolifically across the Bay Area. His life matters, not just his death.

### Yellow Lines (Proceed with Care)

1. **The "Jackie Chan" quote**: Powerful evidence of racial bias. Use it in editorial/press contexts, not on product descriptions or marketing copy.

2. **The grand jury exoneration**: Important context for the injustice narrative. Appropriate for press, not for product pages.

3. **"Unarmed 18-year-old"**: True and important. Appropriate for storytelling. Should always be accompanied by who he WAS (artist, member of community) not just how he died.

4. **Revenue allocation to family**: If Tie One's family is not involved, don't claim this. If they are, feature it prominently.

### Green Lines (Lean Into)

1. **MQ's 25-year tribute practice**: This is the story's moral authority. Use it everywhere.
2. **The art itself**: Let the work speak. Product photography, studio process, sticker history.
3. **Community connection**: DMS, BBB, the crews, the culture. This is grounded and real.
4. **San Francisco as homecoming**: The drop happening in Tie One's city is powerful and appropriate.
5. **Accessibility**: The price ladder means anyone can participate. This is Keith Haring's Pop Shop philosophy.

## 6. ONE-WAY DOOR: Narrative Framing

**Decision**: Lead with the brotherhood and the 25-year tribute. Contextualize the injustice. Never sensationalize.

**Why this is irreversible**: Once the narrative is public — in press, on social, in people's minds — it cannot be retracted or reframed. Getting the tone wrong on launch poisons everything that follows.

**Specific commitments**:
- Use "came up in the same early 1980s Manhattan scene" (NOT "painted alongside Keith Haring")
- Frame as tribute and celebration, not tragedy exploitation
- Include Tie One's full humanity in all storytelling
- Treat the "Jackie Chan" quote as editorial context, not marketing copy

**Confirmation required before Phase 3.**
