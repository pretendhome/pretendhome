# MQ x TIE ONE — DROP PLAN
### Rossi Mission | 791 Valencia Street, San Francisco
### February 2026

---

## THE STORY

**MQ** (MKUE/MQUE) is a NYC graffiti legend — DMS crew, early 1980s Manhattan scene, gallery-represented (Martinez Gallery), published in i-D Magazine, Dr. Martens, The Wild Styles. Known for his stamp-like throw-ups and sticker campaigns across Tokyo, Paris, Berlin, and Mexico City.

**Tie One** (Jonathan See Lim, 1979–1998) was a Bay Area graffiti writer — Filipino immigrant, raised Buddhist, affiliated with Reds, RTC, R10, THR, T2B, BBB, and KCW crews. On March 18, 1998, he was shot and killed on a fire escape at 120 Taylor Street in the Tenderloin while painting. He was 18 and unarmed. The shooter, William Porter, was exonerated by a grand jury.

**The Connection**: MQ has been creating Tie One tribute art — stickers, merch, memorial pieces — for years without monetization. Verified: 2022 partnership with Low Key Skate Shop SF for a Tie One sticker pack released near the March 18 anniversary.

**Why Now**: For the first time, MQ brings this tribute practice into a gallery — in San Francisco, Tie One's city.

---

## THE DROP

**What**: 8-SKU limited collection — apparel, accessories, sticker packs — ranging from $10 to $95.

**Where**: 791 Valencia Street (gallery exhibition) + rossimission.com (Shopify).

**When**: 8-week narrative buildup → Friday gallery opening → Saturday online drop → 2-week exhibition → hard close.

**Format**: Exhibition Hybrid — gallery opening with MQ present, followed by online Shopify drop next morning, then 2-week exhibition window. Everything pulled after 3 weeks. "Sold out" is permanent.

## AUDIENCE

| Segment | Who | Budget | % of Buyers | % of Revenue |
|---------|-----|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Writers** | Graffiti community, 25-55 | $10-$50 | 40-50% | 15-20% |
| **Collectors** | Urban art buyers, 30-60 | $200+ | 5-10% | 30-40% |
| **Hype** | Streetwear consumers, 18-30 | $40-$120 | 15-25% | 25-30% |
| **Story** | General public / social justice, 25-50 | $10-$60 | 15-25% | 10-15% |

**Rule**: Graffiti community hears about this FIRST — from within the culture (12ozProphet, crews, Low Key) BEFORE mainstream press. If they learn from Hypebeast first, the narrative feels corporate.

## NARRATIVE FRAMING

**Core frame**: Brotherhood — the graffiti community honoring one of its own.

**Per-segment angles**:
- **Writers**: "NYC legend honors Bay Area writer with first-ever gallery tribute"
- **Collectors**: "From stickers to gallery — MQ's tribute redefines memorial art"
- **Hype**: "Limited collection, 8 SKUs, hard close after 3 weeks"
- **Story**: "Hidden history: 18-year-old Filipino-American artist killed for painting, honored 26 years later"

**Cultural sensitivity**:
- **Do**: Emphasize Tie One's humanity and artistry. Reference the injustice without sensationalizing. Highlight MQ's authentic tribute practice. Credit the family (with permission). Allocate 10% to community cause.
- **Don't**: Focus on violence. Use shooting details as marketing. Claim "Tie One would have wanted this." Reduce him to a martyr.
- **Never**: Use crime scene imagery. Sensationalize racial elements. Speak for the family without permission.

## GALLERY OPENING (T-0, Friday 6-10pm)

| Item | Budget |
|------|--------|
| Beer/wine (100 guests) | $300-$500 |
| DJ | $200-$400 |
| Photographer | $300-$500 |
| Security (2 people, 5 hrs) | $400-$600 |
| Signage/printing | $200-$300 |
| **Total event** | **~$1,500-$2,300** |

## RISKS

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|-----------|
| MQ can't participate | 40% | HIGH | Outreach via Instagram + Martinez Gallery + Low Key. April 25 backup date. |
| Tie One's family objects | 30% | CRITICAL | Early outreach via Low Key. 10% revenue to community cause. Respect any objection immediately. |
| Low graffiti community buy-in | 30% | HIGH | Lead with 12ozProphet, not Hypebeast. Brotherhood framing. MQ's credibility carries this. |
| Low online conversion | 35% | MEDIUM | 8-week narrative buildup. Email list. Abandoned cart recovery. Press coverage. |
| Exploitation backlash | 20% | HIGH | Brotherhood narrative. Revenue allocation. Cultural sensitivity framework. Transparency. |
| Over-production | 15% | MEDIUM | Conservative edition sizes. Break-even at 40%. |

## WHY THIS MATTERS

This is Rossi Mission's first proof-of-concept for the drop model. Success validates the $500K Year 1 retail target and creates a repeatable template for future artist drops. Beyond revenue ($33K target), it builds: an email list (1,000+), press relationships, artist pipeline credibility, and community trust.

The story is real. The numbers work. The risk is managed. The only question is: does MQ say yes?
