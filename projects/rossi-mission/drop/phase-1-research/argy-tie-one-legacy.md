## Executive Summary

Jonathan See Lim, known as **Tie One** (June 19, 1979 – March 18, 1998), was a prolific Bay Area graffiti writer shot and killed at age 18 on a fire escape in San Francisco's Tenderloin neighborhood. The shooter, William Porter, a 51-year-old former war photographer, was exonerated by a grand jury. Tie One's death — and the injustice of the outcome — became a rallying point for the SF graffiti community and beyond. His legacy is actively maintained through memorial murals, global sticker campaigns (led by MQ), and ongoing community tributes. This is NOT an obscure underground figure — there are multiple credible sources documenting his life, death, and cultural significance.

## 2. How Tie One Died

### The Incident (March 18, 1998)
- **Time**: Approximately 1:10 AM
- **Location**: 120 Taylor Street, Tenderloin, San Francisco (fire escape of a residential building)
- **What happened**: Tie One was climbing the exterior of the building, apparently to paint his tag. William Porter, 51, a former war photographer living in the building, heard noise at his kitchen window and armed himself.
- **Porter's account**: He claimed his gun went off after Tie One "grabbed at it." He told SFGate: *"I warned him that I had a firearm. I had no idea that this individual would play Jackie Chan and grab the gun."*
- **Witness account**: A witness told the grand jury she heard Lim, who was **not armed**, plead *"Hold on!"* / *"Please don't shoot!"* just before he was shot.
- **Forensic evidence**: No gun residue was found on Tie One's hands. A witness reported seeing Porter hitting Tie with the gun as he yelled "please don't shoot" while fleeing down the stairs.
- **Death**: Tie One was shot on the fire escape and died on the street below.

### The Aftermath
- **Grand jury**: A divided grand jury exonerated Porter in December 1998. He was cleared of all charges of manslaughter and murder.
- **Community reaction**: Profound and lasting impact on San Francisco's graffiti community. Friends planned a **100-foot memorial mural** at Mission Dolores Park.

### The "Jackie Chan" Quote
Porter's reference to "Jackie Chan" when describing an 18-year-old Filipino teenager has been widely noted as carrying racial overtones. This aspect of the case has been documented by researcher Lei Takanashi and others tracking anti-Asian violence.

## 3. Cultural Significance

### Why Tie One Matters

1. **Symbol of injustice**: An unarmed 18-year-old killed for graffiti. Shooter walks free. The case became a touchstone for discussions about proportional response, race, and criminalization of street art.

2. **Asian-American graffiti representation**: Tie One is documented as part of the [Hidden History of Asian-American Graf Writers](https://www.hiddenrsrch.com/p/the-hidden-history-of-asian-american), placing him in a broader narrative of underrepresented communities in graffiti culture.

3. **Bay Area graffiti canon**: His prolific output and tragic death at 18 cemented him as a legendary figure in SF graffiti history.

4. **Global memorial movement**: His legacy transcended local community. Stickers and artworks across the globe immortalize his memory, making him a **rallying point against intolerance**.

5. **Connection to Rossi Mission territory**: Tie One was active in the Mission District and SF — the same community Rossi Mission serves at 791 Valencia Street. This is a LOCAL story with GLOBAL resonance.

## 6. Broader Context: Violence Against Graffiti Writers

Tie One's death is not isolated. The broader pattern includes:

- **Michael Stewart (1983)**: NYC graffiti artist killed by transit police. NPR documented: ["It Could Have Been Me"](https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2013/09/16/221821224/it-could-have-been-me-the-1983-death-of-a-nyc-graffiti-artist).
- **Memorial mural tradition**: Arose in the 1980s-90s in response to deaths from drugs, racism, police violence, and gun violence. NYC's memorial murals "honor those who've gone, then go themselves" (City Limits).
- **Criminalization**: Graffiti writers face disproportionate consequences — from property charges to vigilante violence — for what is essentially a property crime with no physical victim.
