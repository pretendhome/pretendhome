## Executive Summary

This document establishes pricing benchmarks for the MQ x Tie One tribute drop using real market data from comparable artists, tribute merchandise, and streetwear drops. MQ's current market position (Village Works NYC, $100-$500 for works on paper) places him firmly in **Tier 3** of the graffiti art market. The tribute narrative adds a **20-50% premium** based on comparable memorial pricing. Recommended price ladder: **$5 (stickers) → $45-65 (tees) → $150-300 (limited prints) → $500-2,500 (originals)**.

## 1. Tribute/Memorial Art Pricing

### Does Tribute Art Command a Premium?

**Yes — but the premium comes from the STORY, not the death.**

Evidence across all categories shows that memorial/tribute works command premiums when:
1. The narrative is authentic (not manufactured)
2. The creator has a verified connection to the deceased
3. The work is limited (scarcity + story = maximum premium)

| Category | Standard Price | Tribute Premium | Example |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|---------|
| Memorial merch (music) | $30-$40 tees | 2-3x ($89-$140) | Nipsey Hussle tees at $89.99 vs. standard rap tees at $30-$40 |
| Estate prints (fine art) | Varies | 30-100% premium post-death | Basquiat prints rose significantly after death |
| Posthumous fashion | Standard retail | Brand premium maintained | Off-White maintained $200-$800 pricing post-Abloh |
| Community tribute (graffiti) | $5-$20 stickers | Emotional premium (not monetary) | MQ's Tie One stickers — given away or traded, not priced for profit |

### Key Insight
The MQ x Tie One drop is unique because MQ has been creating tribute art for **25 years without monetizing it**. Converting a free/traded practice into a priced gallery drop requires careful framing — the premium comes from the gallery context and limited editions, not from suddenly charging for something that was previously given freely.

## 2. Comparable Artist Pricing

### Tier 1: Elite Graffiti Artists (For Context Only)
These artists are NOT direct comparables for MQ but establish the ceiling:

| Artist | Medium | Edition | Price Range | Source |
|--------|--------|---------|-------------|--------|
| **Futura 2000** | Screenprint (w/ Murakami) | 100 | $2,250 | Fizzy Magazine |
| **Futura 2000** | LED neon (Yellowpop) | 50-100 | $1,000-$3,000 | Bronx Museum |
| **Shepard Fairey** | Signed screenprint | 300-450 | $200-$2,000 | OBEY Giant Store |
| **KAWS** | Companion figure (1999) | 500 | Primary: $500-$1,000 → Resale: $10,000-$15,000 | Artsy |
| **Basquiat Estate** | Authorized print | 60 | $35,000-$50,000 | Pace Prints |
| **Keith Haring** | Estate prints | Varies | £100-£50,000 | MyArtBroker |
| **Banksy** | Screenprint | 150-600 | $5,000-$500,000+ | Multiple |

### Tier 2: Established Graffiti Artists (Direct Comparables)
These artists are the best pricing benchmarks for MQ:

| Artist | Medium | Edition | Price Range | Source |
|--------|--------|---------|-------------|--------|
| **Cope2** | Signed prints | Limited | $200-$2,000 | Rossi Market Research |
| **Cope2** | Original canvas | Unique | $1,000-$5,000 | Gallery listings |
| **Lady Pink** | Prints | Limited | $200-$1,500 | Gallery listings |
| **Stash** | Prints | Limited | $300-$2,000 | Gallery listings |
| **Crash** | Works on paper | Limited | $500-$3,000 | Auction records |
| **Dondi White** (estate) | Prints | Limited | $1,000-$5,000 | Auction records |

### Tier 3: MQ's Current Market Position
MQ is not Tier 2 in market pricing (yet), but his credentials are Tier 2-level:

| Evidence | Price | Source |
|----------|-------|--------|
| **MQ "LUCY" marker on paper** (9"x12", 2021) | ~$100-$500 range | Village Works NYC |
| **MQ original sticker art** (Tie One tribute, 2000) | Collectible (eBay) | eBay |
| **MQ + Tie One sticker pack** | Free (given away) | Low Key Skate Shop |
| **MQ crew merch** (Went2go Coffee Tokyo shirt) | $30-$50 (estimated) | eBay |

### Gap Analysis
MQ's **credentials** (1980s NYC, DMS crew, Martinez Gallery representation, published interviews) suggest Tier 2 pricing potential, but his **current market** ($100-$500 works on paper) is Tier 3. The tribute drop should price at **upper Tier 3 / lower Tier 2** — credible based on his history, aspirational based on the narrative.

## 3. Edition Size vs. Price Relationships

### Industry Standards

| Edition Size | Price Effect | Typical Use | Examples |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| **1-5 (unique/AP)** | Maximum premium (5-10x open edition) | Originals, artist proofs | MQ originals |
| **10-25** | High premium (3-5x) | Ultra-limited prints | Futura x Murakami (50 online) |
| **25-50** | Strong premium (2-3x) | Limited edition prints | Shepard Fairey standard |
| **50-100** | Moderate premium (1.5-2x) | Gallery editions | KAWS Companion (500 was unusually large) |
| **100-250** | Slight premium (1.2-1.5x) | Accessible limited editions | Shepard Fairey large runs |
| **250-500** | Near open edition pricing | Mass limited | Supreme drops |
| **Open edition** | Base price | Unlimited reproductions | Uniqlo x Basquiat tees |

### What Comparable Artists Use

| Artist | Typical Edition Size | Price | Revenue Per Edition |
|--------|---------------------|-------|-------------------|
| Shepard Fairey | 300-450 | $200-$2,000 | $60K-$900K |
| Futura 2000 x Murakami | 100 (50 online) | $2,250 | $225K |
| KAWS Companion (1999) | 500 | $500-$1,000 | $250K-$500K |
| Cope2 | 25-100 | $200-$2,000 | $5K-$200K |

### Recommended for MQ x Tie One (First Drop)

| Product | Edition Size | Rationale |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| **Originals** | 5-10 pieces | Scarcity drives collector interest |
| **Limited prints (signed)** | 25-50 | Sweet spot: scarce enough to feel special, enough to generate revenue |
| **Open edition prints** | 100-200 | Accessible entry for collectors |
| **Apparel** | 50-100 per SKU | Standard streetwear drop sizing |
| **Stickers/pins** | 200-500 | Entry-level, community-building |

**Key principle**: Better to sell out and create demand for a second drop than to sit on inventory.

## 5. Product Mix for Successful Drops

### What Successful Drops Include

Based on research across Supreme, KAWS, Shepard Fairey, and gallery drops:

| Product Tier | Purpose | % of SKUs | % of Revenue |
|-------------|---------|-----------|-------------|
| **Entry-level** ($5-$25) | Community building, social sharing, gateway | 30-40% | 10-15% |
| **Mid-tier** ($30-$100) | Core revenue, broadest buyer pool | 30-40% | 40-50% |
| **Premium** ($100-$500) | Margin driver, collector appeal | 15-25% | 25-35% |

### Typical SKU Count
- **Streetwear drops**: 10-30 SKUs per drop (Supreme weekly)
- **Gallery artist drops**: 5-15 SKUs
- **First-time drops**: 8-12 SKUs recommended (manageable production, enough variety)

### Recommended Product Mix: MQ x Tie One

| # | Product | Edition | Price | Revenue Potential |
|---|---------|---------|-------|-------------------|
| 1 | **MQ x Tie One sticker pack** (5 pcs) | 300 | $10 | $3,000 |
| 2 | **Enamel pin** (Tie One tribute design) | 200 | $15 | $3,000 |
| 3 | **Zine** (MQ + Tie One story, photos, art) | 200 | $20 | $4,000 |
| 4 | **Graphic tee** (Design A) | 100 | $45 | $4,500 |
| 5 | **Graphic tee** (Design B) | 100 | $45 | $4,500 |
| 6 | **Hoodie** | 75 | $85 | $6,375 |
| 7 | **Hat/cap** | 100 | $40 | $4,000 |
| 8 | **Open edition print** (signed) | 150 | $60 | $9,000 |
| 9 | **Limited edition print** (signed, numbered) | 25 | $200 | $5,000 |
| 10 | **Original work on paper** | 5-10 | $500-$1,500 | $2,500-$15,000 |
| 11 | **Hero piece** (large original) | 1-3 | $2,000-$3,000 | $2,000-$9,000 |
| | | | **TOTAL** | **$47,875-$67,375** |

*Revenue assumes full sellout. Rossi's 50/50 split after COGS means gallery take ≈ 35-40% of gross.*

## 7. Pricing Strategy Recommendations

### 1. Price at Upper Tier 3 / Lower Tier 2
MQ's credentials justify higher pricing than his current market ($100-$500), but jumping to Tier 1 pricing ($2,000+ prints) would lack credibility. The tribute narrative allows a **20-50% premium** over standard MQ pricing.

### 2. Use the Price Ladder
Every successful drop has a ladder from accessible to aspirational:
- **$10** (stickers) — anyone can participate
- **$45** (tee) — standard streetwear buyer
- **$200** (limited print) — entry-level collector
- **$1,500** (original) — serious collector
- **$3,000** (hero piece) — anchor that makes $200 feel reasonable

### 3. Never Discount
Scarcity-based drops must NEVER discount. If items don't sell at launch, reduce edition sizes for the next drop — don't lower prices. Discounting signals the drop wasn't worth the original price and permanently undermines perceived value.

### 4. Rossi's 50/50 Split
Rossi's standard model is 50/50 after COGS. For a $45 tee:
- COGS: ~$12-$15 (quality blanks + printing)
- Gross after COGS: $30-$33
- Artist (MQ): $15-$16.50
- Gallery (Rossi): $15-$16.50

For a $200 print:
- COGS: ~$20-$40 (printing, paper, framing)
- Gross after COGS: $160-$180
- Artist (MQ): $80-$90
- Gallery (Rossi): $80-$90

### 5. Consider a Tie One Tribute Allocation
Based on tribute drop best practices (see argy-tribute-art-drops.md), consider allocating a percentage of proceeds to:
- Tie One's family
- A graffiti arts education fund
- A memorial project

This is both ethically appropriate and commercially smart — it strengthens the narrative and defuses any "profiting from death" critique.
