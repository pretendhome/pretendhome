# MQ × TIE ONE: DROP PLAYBOOK
### Rossi Mission — 791 Valencia Street, San Francisco
### Prepared by Palette Agent Toolkit | 2026-02-11

---

## 1. Executive Summary

This playbook is the complete operational guide for Rossi Mission's first artist drop: a tribute collection by NYC graffiti legend **MQ** (MKUE/MQUE) honoring **Tie One** (Jonathan See Lim, 1979-1998), a Bay Area graffiti writer shot and killed at age 18 in San Francisco's Tenderloin neighborhood.

**What**: 12-SKU limited collection — originals, prints, apparel, accessories — ranging from $10 to $2,500

**Where**: 791 Valencia Street (gallery exhibition) + rossimission.com (Shopify)

**When**: 8-week narrative buildup → Friday gallery opening → Saturday online drop → 2-week exhibition window → hard close

**Revenue forecast**: $34,150 (conservative) to $62,474 (aggressive). Target: $51,520 (moderate, 80% sellthrough).

**Why this matters**: This is Rossi's first proof-of-concept for the drop model. Success here validates the business plan's $500K retail Year 1 target and creates a template for future artist drops.

## 2. The Story

### MQ
MQ (also known as MKUE, MQUE, MQism) is a documented NYC graffiti writer who emerged from the early 1980s Manhattan scene. Affiliated with **DMS** (Doc Marten Stomp) crew, deeply connected to New York Hardcore culture. Gallery-represented (Martinez Gallery), published in Living Proof New York ("New York Graffiti Icon"), i-D Magazine, Dr. Martens, and The Wild Styles. Known for his stamp-like throw-up style and hyper-aggressive sticker campaigns spanning Tokyo, Paris, Berlin, and Mexico City.

MQ came up in the same early 1980s Manhattan graffiti scene that produced Keith Haring, Basquiat, and the downtown art revolution.

### Tie One
Jonathan See Lim — known as Tie One — was born June 19, 1979 in the Philippines. A Filipino immigrant raised Buddhist, he became a prolific Bay Area graffiti writer affiliated with Reds, RTC, R10, THR, T2B, BBB, and KCW crews. He painted across San Jose, San Francisco, and Stockton.

On March 18, 1998, Tie One was shot and killed on a fire escape at 120 Taylor Street in the Tenderloin while painting. He was 18 and unarmed. The shooter, William Porter, was exonerated by a grand jury.

### The Connection
MQ has been creating tribute art for Tie One for **over 25 years** — stickers, merch, memorial art — without monetization. The connection is documented through eBay listings (original 2000-era sticker art), a partnership with Low Key Skate Shop SF (free Tie One sticker packs, 2022), and shared crew references (DMS, BBB).

### Why Now
For the first time, MQ brings this 25-year tribute practice into a gallery — and it's happening in San Francisco, Tie One's city.

## 6. Marketing Channels

### Channel Priority and Sequencing

| Priority | Channel | Segment | Timing |
|----------|---------|---------|--------|
| #1 | **Instagram** | All segments | T-8 → T+21 |
| #2 | **Email list** | All segments | T-6 → T+21 |
| #3 | **Physical gallery** | Local / Collectors | T-0 → T+14 |
| #4 | **Graffiti forums** (12ozProphet) | Graffiti community | T-4 → T-1 |
| #5 | **Art press** (Juxtapoz, Hyperallergic) | Collectors | T-4 → T+1 |
| #6 | **Local press** (SFGate, Mission Local) | General public | T-3 → T+1 |
| #7 | **Streetwear press** (Hypebeast) | Streetwear | T-2 → T+1 |
| #8 | **TikTok** | Streetwear / General | T-4 → T+7 |
| #9 | **Asian-American media** | Social justice | T-2 → T+7 |

### Critical Rule: Graffiti Community First
The graffiti community must hear about this from within the culture BEFORE mainstream press. If they learn about it from Hypebeast before 12ozProphet, the narrative feels corporate.

## 11. Risk Register

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| **Low attendance at opening** | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | Pre-event RSVP push. MQ's network + Rossi's network. Opening is the marketing event, not the revenue event — online drop catches overflow. |
| **Low online conversion** | MEDIUM | HIGH | 8-week narrative buildup. Email list. Press coverage. Abandoned cart recovery. |
| **MQ can't travel** | LOW | HIGH | Backup: MQ joins via video call for opening. Still ships artwork. |
| **Press doesn't cover** | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | Multiple pitch angles (art, justice, streetwear, Asian-American). If press fails, organic social + community still drives core audience. |
| **Tie One's family objects** | LOW | CRITICAL | Attempt early outreach. If family objects, pivot to "MQ tribute practice" framing without family involvement. Revenue allocation to community cause (not family) as fallback. |
| **Over-production / dead stock** | LOW | MEDIUM | Conservative edition sizes. Break-even at 32%. Unsold entry-level items (stickers, pins) useful as promotional giveaways. |
| **Exploitation backlash** | LOW | HIGH | Brotherhood-led narrative. 25-year tribute history proves authenticity. Revenue allocation to cause. Cultural sensitivity framework (see rex-narrative-arc.md). |
| **Shopify issues on drop day** | LOW | MEDIUM | Shopify handles major brand drops. Test site under simulated load. Manual publishing backup plan. |
| **Pricing too high / too low** | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | Market-rate positioning backed by benchmarks. Never discount. If items don't sell, reduce edition sizes for Drop 2. |
