- Revised: 45% retail, 26% grants (diversified but grant-heavy for a fashion brand)
- Creative Growth: Balanced 33/34/32 split (proven over 50 years)

**Question**: Can a fashion/streetwear brand sustain 26% grant dependency?

## VISUAL 2: Artist Pipeline Funnel

### Conversion Funnel
```
Community Reach: 1,000+ people
         ↓ (12% engage)
Workshop Participants: 120/year
         ↓ (10% conversion - UNVALIDATED)
Roster Candidates: 12/year
         ↓ (67% acceptance)
Active Roster: 80 artists (current)
         ↓ (10% become top performers)
Top Performers: 8 artists (generate 60-70% of revenue)
```

### Revenue Distribution
| Tier | # Artists | Avg Annual Gross | Artist Net (50%) | % of Total Revenue |
|------|-----------|-----------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Top | 8 | $37,500-$43,750 | $18,750-$21,875 | 60-70% |
| Mid | 24 | $4,200-$5,200 | $2,100-$2,600 | 20-25% |
| Bottom | 48 | $520-$2,080 | $260-$1,040 | 10-15% |

### Key Insight for Product Manager
- 10% workshop conversion rate is UNVALIDATED (no workshops conducted yet)
- 60% of roster earns <$1,000/year (retention risk)
- Pipeline depends on continuous talent discovery (workshops must work)

**Question**: Can you build a sustainable product on 10% conversion rates?

- Each new location must generate $300-400K in Year 1 of operations
- Assumes partner galleries achieve Rossi SF's performance immediately

**Question**: Is 99% Year 1-to-Year 2 growth operationally feasible?

---

## VISUAL 4: SKU Management Strategy

### Scarcity Economics Model
```
TRADITIONAL GALLERY MODEL:
Location 1: 500 SKUs → 1,000 SKUs → 2,000 SKUs (depth)
Result: Dilution, overstock, clearance sales

ROSSI MODEL (Supreme-inspired):
Location 1: 250 SKUs (cap)
Location 2: 250 SKUs (cap)
Location 3: 250 SKUs (cap)
Result: Scarcity maintained, breadth not depth
```

### SKU Composition (per location)
| Category | SKUs | Price Range | % of Inventory |
|----------|------|-------------|----------------|
| Originals | 75-100 | $500-$3,000 | 30-40% |
| Limited Prints | 75-100 | $50-$300 | 30-40% |
| Merchandise | 50-75 | $15-$100 | 20-30% |
| **TOTAL** | **250 (cap)** | | **100%** |

### Key Insight for Product Manager
- 250 SKU cap per location (Supreme model)
- Expansion through new locations, not more inventory
- Requires discipline: saying no to new products

**Question**: Does scarcity work for emerging artists? Or only established brands?

---

## VISUAL 5: Brand Collaboration Framework

### Approval Process
```
Collaboration Opportunity
         ↓
Artist Veto Check (individual artist can refuse)
         ↓ (if approved)
Artist Advisory Council Review (cultural fit)
         ↓ (if approved)
Board Approval (financial/legal)
         ↓ (if approved)
Collaboration Executed
         ↓
Revenue Split: 70% Artist / 30% Rossi
```

### Annual Collaboration Cap
| Year | Max Collaborations | Avg Revenue/Collab | Total Revenue | Rationale |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------|-----------|
| Year 1 | 2-3 | $15,000-$20,000 | $40,000 | Conservative, build reputation |
| Year 2 | 3-4 | $20,000-$30,000 | $100,000 | Established credibility |
| Year 3 | 4-5 | $40,000-$50,000 | $200,000 | Premium brand partnerships |

### Key Insight for Product Manager
- 3-5 collaborations per year (scarcity protection)
- Artist veto power preserved (cultural fit over revenue)
- 70/30 split (artist-favorable)

**Question**: Is 3-5 per year enough revenue? Or leaving money on the table?

## VISUAL 6: Cash Flow Danger Zones

### 18-Month Cash Position
```
Month:  1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9   10   11   12   13   14   15   16   17   18
Cash:  65K  57K  50K  69K  61K  57K  45K  39K  48K  44K  39K  41K  21K  16K  26K  17K  10K  13K
        ↑                   ↑                                       ↑              ↑
     Start            Grant                                    Grant         DANGER
                     Arrives                                  Arrives         ZONE
```

### Danger Zone Analysis
| Period | Cash Balance | Issue | Trigger |
|--------|-------------|-------|---------|
| **Months 7-11** | $39K-$48K | Hiring before revenue (semi-variable costs +61%) | Staff expansion |
| **Month 17** | $10,480 | Grant delay + seasonal retail dip | Year 2 transition |

### Emergency Protocols (if cash < $20K)
1. Freeze non-essential spending (marketing, content equipment)
2. Delay new hires by 90 days
3. Accelerate grant applications
4. Pursue bridge financing (line of credit)
5. Increase corporate workshop outreach

### Key Insight for Product Manager
- Month 17 is existential risk ($10K cash = 3 days of operations)
- Hiring in Month 7 creates cash squeeze before revenue ramps
- Grant timing is unpredictable (60-90 days after award)

**Question**: Can you launch products/programs on this cash flow timeline?

## VISUAL 7: Partner Network Economics

### Revenue Flow Model
```
PARTNER GALLERY (LA):
Retail Sales: $350K
├─ COGS (30%): $105K
├─ Net: $245K
├─ Artist Payments (50%): $122.5K
└─ Partner Keeps: $122.5K

Collaboration Brokered by Rossi: $20K
├─ Artist (70%): $14K
├─ Partner (10%): $2K
└─ Rossi Finder's Fee (20%): $4K

Online Sales via Rossi Platform: $50K
├─ COGS (30%): $15K
├─ Net: $35K
├─ Artist (50%): $17.5K
├─ Partner (40%): $14K
└─ Rossi Platform Fee (10%): $3.5K
```

### Rossi Revenue from Partner Network
| Partner Activity | Partner Revenue | Rossi Revenue | Rossi % |
|-----------------|----------------|---------------|---------|
| Retail Sales | $350K | $0 | 0% |
| Collaborations (brokered) | $20K | $4K | 20% |
| Online Sales (platform) | $50K | $3.5K | 7% |
| **TOTAL** | **$420K** | **$7.5K** | **1.8%** |

### Key Insight for Product Manager
- Partners keep 100% of retail revenue (no franchise fees)
- Rossi earns only on brokered collaborations (20%) and platform sales (10%)
- Year 2 projects $470K revenue increase from 2-3 partners, but Rossi only captures ~$30-50K

**Question**: Is this enough revenue for Rossi? Or are partners getting a free ride?

## VISUAL 8: Content-Driven Discovery Model

### GX1000 Model Applied to Rossi
```
CONTENT CREATION (Operational Function, not Marketing)
├─ Artist Stories (origin, style, process)
├─ Process Videos (live painting, studio work)
├─ Event Documentation (exhibitions, workshops)
└─ Residency Chronicles (artist journey)
         ↓
DISTRIBUTION (Social Media + Website)
├─ Instagram: 2,000-10,000 followers (current)
├─ YouTube: Artist documentaries
├─ TikTok: Short-form content
└─ Website: Long-form stories
         ↓
DISCOVERY (Audience Engagement)
├─ Social Media Reach: 50,000-200,000 impressions/month
├─ Website Traffic: 1,000-5,000 visitors/month
└─ Email List: 500-2,000 subscribers
         ↓
CONVERSION (Gallery Visits → Sales)
├─ Gallery Foot Traffic: 30-60 visitors/day
├─ Conversion Rate: 3-5% (industry standard)
└─ Sales: 1-3 transactions/day
```

### Content Budget
| Year | Content Production | Equipment | Personnel | Total | % of Revenue |
|------|-------------------|-----------|-----------|-------|--------------|
| Year 1 | $40,000 | $10,000 | $10,000 | $60,000 | 7.7% |
| Year 2 | $70,000 | $5,000 | $25,000 | $100,000 | 6.5% |
| Year 3 | $100,000 | $5,000 | $45,000 | $150,000 | 5.6% |

### Key Insight for Product Manager
- Content is operational function (not marketing cost)
- GX1000 model: documentation drives discovery
- But GX1000 is a skate crew with cult following (different from emerging artists)

**Question**: Does content-driven discovery actually drive sales for emerging artists?

---

## VISUAL 9: Pareto Distribution Reality

### Artist Revenue Distribution (Year 1 Projection)
```
TOP TIER (8 artists, 10%):
Revenue: $300K-$350K (60-70% of total)
Per Artist: $37,500-$43,750 gross → $18,750-$21,875 net
Status: Meaningful income, sustainable career

MID TIER (24 artists, 30%):
Revenue: $100K-$125K (20-25% of total)
Per Artist: $4,200-$5,200 gross → $2,100-$2,600 net
Status: Supplemental income, not sustainable alone

BOTTOM TIER (48 artists, 60%):
Revenue: $25K-$75K (10-15% of total)
Per Artist: $520-$1,560 gross → $260-$780 net
Status: Emerging, minimal income
```

### Retention Risk Analysis
| Tier | Annual Net Income | Retention Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------------|----------------|------------|
| Top | $18K-$22K | LOW | Meaningful income, strong incentive to stay |
| Mid | $2K-$3K | MODERATE | Supplemental income, may leave for better opportunities |
| Bottom | $260-$780 | HIGH | Minimal income, high churn expected |

### Pipeline Function
- **Goal**: Move artists UP the tiers over time
- **Mechanism**: Workshops discover → Residencies develop → Content showcases → Sales increase
- **Reality**: 60% of roster will always be in bottom tier (new talent pipeline)

### Key Insight for Product Manager
- Pareto distribution is inevitable (validated by Creative Growth's 50-year track record)
- Bottom 60% earn <$1,000/year (not sustainable income)
- Pipeline must continuously move artists up OR accept high churn

**Question**: How do you manage a roster where 60% earn <$1,000/year?

## VISUAL 10: Year 1-3 Growth Trajectory

### Revenue Growth Projections
```
Year 1 (2026): $780,000
         ↓ (+99% growth)
Year 2 (2027): $1,550,000
         ↓ (+74% growth)
Year 3 (2028): $2,700,000
```

### Growth Drivers
| Year | SF Flagship | New Locations | Partner Revenue | Total |
|------|------------|---------------|-----------------|-------|
| Year 1 | $780K | $0 | $0 | $780K |
| Year 2 | $850K | $650K (LA + Oakland) | $50K | $1,550K |
| Year 3 | $1,000K | $1,500K (5 locations) | $200K | $2,700K |

### Comparison to Benchmarks
| Organization | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Growth Rate |
|-------------|--------|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Rossi (projected)** | $780K | $1,550K | $2,700K | 99% / 74% |
| **Creative Growth (mature)** | $3.26M | $3.26M | $3.26M | Stable (mature org) |
| **Typical Nonprofit Gallery** | $200K | $250K | $300K | 20-25% annual |
| **Venture-Backed Startup** | $500K | $2M | $5M | 100%+ annual |

### Key Insight for Product Manager
- Rossi's growth rate is venture-scale (99% Year 1-to-2)
- But Rossi is a nonprofit, not a venture-backed startup
- Each new location must generate $300-400K immediately (no ramp-up time)

**Question**: Is this realistic for a fashion brand? Or venture-scale fantasy?
