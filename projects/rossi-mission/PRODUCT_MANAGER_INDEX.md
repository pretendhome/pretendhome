## 🚀 FINAL NOTE

The Business Manager and Underwriter have done rigorous analytical work. The package is professionally structured and well-researched.

**But they're not fashion experts. You are.**

Your assessment will determine if this business plan can actually execute in the fashion/streetwear market.

**Your lens is different. Your questions are different. Your assessment matters.**
