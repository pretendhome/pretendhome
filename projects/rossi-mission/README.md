# Rossi Mission Project - Business Plan Development

**Status**: In Progress  
**Framework**: Palette Agent System  
**Date Started**: 2026-02-06

---

## Project Overview

Developing a research-backed business plan for Rossi Mission Project (graffiti art gallery and streetwear brand at 791 Valencia Street, San Francisco) to enable informed decisions on expansion, organizational structure, and revenue optimization.

## Convergence Brief (RIU-001)

### Goal
Produce a research-backed business plan that enables the Rossi team to make informed decisions on organizational structure, artist pipeline, network expansion, and revenue model.

### Roles
- **Human**: Approve ONE-WAY DOOR decisions, provide Rossi-specific context, final review
- **Argentavis (Argy)**: Research global markets (what has worked where and why), nonprofit structures, comparable organizations, grant landscape, artist career trajectories
- **Tyrannosaurus (Rex)**: Design organizational architecture, artist pipeline, network model, revenue streams, validate constraints with evidence
- **Yutyrannus (Yuty)**: Create final presentation (slide deck + written brief)
- **Ankylosaurus (Anky)**: Validate assumptions, identify weaknesses, quality check

### Constraints (to be validated with evidence)
- 50/50 artist profit split (validate: does this enable or limit growth?)
- Network/Tribe model vs franchise (validate: what are the actual tradeoffs?)
- Scarcity protection (validate: how do you scale without dilution?)
- Founder dependency elimination (validate: what governance structures work?)
- Content/Product creation as operational function (clarification: "content" = artist work, products, documentation, media - the lines blur in graffiti)

### Revenue Clarification
Revenue growth IS a priority - the organization needs to maximize profit to survive. The constraint is: don't optimize for revenue *at the expense of* artist relationships, scarcity, or cultural authenticity. Find the path that maximizes revenue *within* those constraints.

### Non-Goals
- NOT a VC pitch deck
- NOT a franchise expansion plan
- NOT making the nonprofit decision (that's for Rossi team)

### Success Criteria
- Rossi team can make informed ONE-WAY DOOR decisions
- All claims backed by global case study research
- Constraints are validated (or challenged) with evidence
- Financial model addresses current revenue problem with concrete solutions
- Presentation is clear enough for non-business people to understand

## Workflow Phases

### Phase 1: Convergence ✅
- Created Semantic Blueprint
- Defined roles, constraints, success criteria
- Approved by human

### Phase 2: Research (In Progress)
**Agent**: Argentavis (Argy)

**Research Tasks**:
1. Global market analysis - what graffiti/street art models work where and why
2. Organizational structures - nonprofit vs for-profit vs hybrid (legal, tax, fundraising)
3. Artist collective governance models
4. Grant landscape (global + US + California + SF)
5. Comparable organizations (Stüssy Tribe, ALIFE, GX1000, Chito, Barry McGee trajectories)
6. Revenue models - what works for artist collectives globally

**Status**: Starting

### Phase 3: Architecture
**Agent**: Tyrannosaurus (Rex)

**Tasks**:
- Validate constraints with evidence
- Design organizational structure
- Design artist pipeline (3-tier system)
- Design network expansion model
- Design revenue model (9+ streams)
- Flag ONE-WAY DOOR decisions

**Status**: Pending research completion

### Phase 4: Validation
**Agent**: Ankylosaurus (Anky)

**Tasks**:
- Critical assumption audit
- Competitive response analysis
- Weakness identification
- Quality check against case studies

**Status**: Pending architecture completion

### Phase 5: Presentation
**Agent**: Yutyrannus (Yuty)

**Tasks**:
- Create slide deck
- Create written brief
- Synthesize research + architecture into decision framework

**Status**: Pending validation completion

## Key Decisions to Make

### ONE-WAY DOOR Decisions (Rossi Team)
1. Nonprofit vs For-Profit vs Hybrid structure
2. Network expansion model (partner gallery criteria)
3. Artist contract structure (50/50 split, terms, IP rights)
4. Geographic expansion strategy
5. Brand collaboration policy

### TWO-WAY DOOR Decisions (Can iterate)
- Content production cadence
- Workshop pricing
- Event formats
- Social media strategy
- Partner gallery onboarding process
