# Technical Context

**Stack**: Business planning and financial modeling (non-technical product)  
**Tools**: Python (document generation), Office suite (deliverables)  
**Infrastructure**: N/A (business planning phase)

## Technical Constraints
- Deliverables must be in Word/PowerPoint format

- Data sources must be verifiable and cited

## Architecture Decisions
- Use Python for automated document generation
- Maintain source data in structured formats (YAML/JSON)
- Generate final deliverables programmatically for consistency
