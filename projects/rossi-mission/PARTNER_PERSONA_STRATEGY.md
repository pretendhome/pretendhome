## RISK MITIGATION BY PERSONA

### Artist Collectives
**Risk**: Collective leadership changes, artists leave collective  
**Mitigation**: Contract with collective entity (not individuals), 30-day termination clause

### Individual Artists
**Risk**: Artist signs exclusive with competitor, quality issues, artist becomes unreliable  
**Mitigation**: Non-exclusive agreements, quality review process, diversify artist base (50+ artists)

### Physical Retail
**Risk**: Low sell-through, inventory damage, retail partner closes  
**Mitigation**: Consignment model (no upfront cost), insurance requirement, quarterly rotation

### Brands
**Risk**: Brand doesn't pay, scope creep, artist-brand conflict  
**Mitigation**: 50% deposit required, clear SOW, Rossi mediates disputes

### Online Marketplaces
**Risk**: Platform changes terms, competition increases  
**Mitigation**: Diversify across multiple platforms, build proprietary platform

### Community Enablers
**Risk**: Reputational damage if partner has scandal  
**Mitigation**: Vet partners carefully, non-exclusive relationships, clear boundaries
