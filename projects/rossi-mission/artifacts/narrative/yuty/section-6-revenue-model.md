# Section 6: Revenue Model

**Rossi Mission Project Business Plan**  
**Date**: February 2026

---

## Overview: 7-Stream Diversification Strategy

Rossi operates a **7-stream revenue model** designed to protect against single-source failure. Research shows successful artist collectives have 5-7 revenue streams, never just one [Research: task-6-revenue-models.md]. No single stream exceeds 40% of total revenue, ensuring sustainability through market cycles.

**Organizational Structure**: Fiscal sponsorship hybrid enables this diversification:
- **Rossi Mission Project** (501(c)(3) via fiscal sponsor): Grants, workshop fees, residency sponsorships, donations
- **Rossi Gallery LLC** (for-profit): Retail sales, brand collaborations, online/digital sales

This structure preserves 50/50 artist profit-split (through LLC) while enabling grant access (through 501(c)(3)) [Research: task-2-nonprofit-vs-forprofit.md].

## Revenue Stream 1: Retail Sales (Gallery + Online)

### Model
Physical gallery (791 Valencia Street) + e-commerce platform (Shopify) selling original art, limited edition prints, and merchandise.

### Product Mix
- **Originals**: $500-$3,000+ (30-40% of SKUs, 50-60% of retail revenue)
- **Limited Edition Prints**: $100-$500 (30-40% of SKUs, 25-30% of retail revenue)
- **Merchandise**: $15-$100 (20-30% of SKUs, 15-20% of retail revenue)
- **Collaborations**: Limited releases (5-10% of SKUs, 5-10% of retail revenue)

### Scarcity Discipline
- Cap at 250 SKUs per location (never exceed)
- Limited edition prints never reprinted once sold out
- Expand through new locations (breadth), not more inventory (depth)

### Artist Split
**50/50 after COGS** (artist gets 50% of net sales)

**Example**: $200 print sells, $20 production cost = $180 net → Artist receives $90, Rossi receives $90

### Revenue Projections
- **Year 1**: $500K (SF flagship + online)
  - Originals: $275K | Prints: $150K | Merchandise: $75K
- **Year 2**: $750K (SF growth + 2-3 partner collaboration revenue)
  - Originals: $400K | Prints: $225K | Merchandise: $125K
- **Year 3**: $1.2M (SF + 5-7 partner network)
  - Originals: $650K | Prints: $375K | Merchandise: $175K

### Capacity
- **Public Workshops**: 12-15 people, monthly (12/year Year 1)
- **Corporate Workshops**: 15-25 people, quarterly (4-6/year Year 1)
