## Sensitivity Analysis

### Scenario 1: Grants Cut 50%

**Impact**: -$25K Year 1, -$38K Year 2, -$63K Year 3

**Mitigation**:
- Increase workshop frequency (2 additional corporate workshops = +$10K)
- Pursue more collaborations (1 additional deal = +$5K-$10K)
- Reduce content production (1.0 FTE → 0.75 FTE = -$15K expense)

**Result**: Deficit increases to -$100K Year 1, but still manageable with bridge financing

### Scenario 2: Retail Sales Decline 20%

**Impact**: -$100K Year 1, -$150K Year 2, -$240K Year 3

**Mitigation**:
- Diversified revenue (retail is 57-64% of total, not 80%+)
- Online sales growth (shift to e-commerce, lower overhead)
- Events drive traffic (not reliant on passive walk-ins)
- Partner network (geographic diversification reduces SF-specific risk)

**Result**: Deficit increases to -$175K Year 1, requires additional bridge financing or expense cuts

### Scenario 3: Partner Expansion Slower (2 partners Year 2, 4 partners Year 3)

**Impact**: -$100K Year 2, -$300K Year 3 (reduced collaboration revenue, workshop revenue)

**Mitigation**:
- Focus on SF flagship growth (increase inventory turnover, not SKU count)
- Pursue more SF-based collaborations (local brands, tech companies)
- Delay personnel expansion (hold at 4.0 FTE Year 2-3)

**Result**: Year 2 deficit -$92K, Year 3 surplus +$50K (slower growth, but still sustainable)

### Scenario 4: Best Case (All Streams +20%)

**Impact**: +$156K Year 1, +$250K Year 2, +$427K Year 3

**Use of Surplus**:
- Build reserve fund (6 months operating expenses = $400K-$500K)
- Accelerate partner expansion (add 2-3 additional partners Year 3)
- Increase artist payments (55/45 split instead of 50/50)
- Invest in technology (custom e-commerce platform, CRM upgrade)
