## THE OPPORTUNITY (1 PAGE)

### Why AI, Why Now, Why Gap

Gap Inc. has strong momentum: 8 consecutive quarters of market share gains, 41.3% gross margin (highest in 20 years), and $2.4B in cash reserves. CEO Richard Dickson's "digital-first organization" vision is working. The Google Cloud partnership (October 2025) provides the foundation. Now we need to operationalize it.

**The Problem We're Solving**:
- $50M-$100M/year in operational waste (inventory overstock, markdown waste, manual processes)
- 60-70% of store associate time on tasks, not customers
- Manual forecasting and pricing decisions based on intuition, not data
- 200+ AI models fragmenting into tool sprawl (consolidating into Gemini Enterprise)

**The Opportunity**:
AI can reduce waste, free up employees for higher-value work, and improve decision-making — but only if we do it right. Not 100 tools. Not pure automation. Not AI replacing people. One agentic system that makes every employee more capable at their specific job.

**Why Gap Is Positioned to Win**:
- Executive commitment (CEO Dickson's digital-first vision, CTO Gerjets' 30+ years experience)
- Platform foundation (Google Cloud: Gemini Enterprise, Vertex AI, BigQuery)
- Financial strength ($2.4B cash, 41.3% gross margin)
- Brand momentum (8 consecutive quarters of market share gains)
- Multi-brand structure (4 brands = learning lab, not single point of failure)

**What Success Looks Like**:
Employees feel more valued as individuals because they're using AI. Their work is faster, more complete, better — so they deliver with confidence. Store associates spend more time with customers. Store managers understand their teams better. Merchandisers make pricing decisions with data, not just intuition. And the budget shrinks because we did it right.

## THE STRATEGY (2 PAGES)

### Forward Deployed Engineer (FDE) Model

**Not building platforms from scratch. Integrating AI onto existing infrastructure.**

We're adopting the Forward Deployed Engineer model (pioneered by Palantir, used by Databricks, Stripe, Accenture):
- Embed AI experts with business units (stores, merchandising, supply chain, brands)
- Build on existing systems (Google Cloud, Workday, ServiceNow, inventory systems)
- Rapid iteration (12-week pilots, not 12-month platform builds)
- Outcome-focused (business results, not technical metrics)

**Office of AI Structure** (10-11 FTE):
- **6 Forward Deployed Engineers** (FDEs): Embedded with Old Navy, Gap, Banana Republic, Athleta, Corporate Functions, Supply Chain
- **3-4 Central Support**: AI Governance Specialist, Data Engineer, AI Adoption Lead, AI Product Manager (optional)
- **1 Leadership**: Mical Neill (Sr. Manager, AI Strategy & Enterprise Enablement)

**Why FDE Model Works**:
- 35-40% cheaper than platform model ($7.2M-$7.8M over 3 years vs. $10M+)
- Faster time-to-value (weeks vs. months)
- Better adoption (FDEs embedded with business units, not centralized team)
- Proven at scale (Accenture: 30K FDEs, Infosys: 4,600+ AI projects)

---

### Hybrid Governance: Central Platform + Brand Autonomy

**Learning from LVMH** (75 maisons, 40K employees using MaIA, 2M+ monthly AI requests):

**Centralized (Office of AI)**:
- One agentic platform (Gemini Enterprise on Google Cloud)
- Security, compliance, risk management
- Cross-brand learning mechanisms
- Budget for shared platform

**Federated (Brand Teams)**:
- Each brand prioritizes own use cases (Old Navy: operations-first, Banana Republic: customer experience)
- Brand leaders own implementation and adoption
- Brand-specific pilots and rollouts
- Budget for brand use cases

**Why This Works**:
- Preserves brand autonomy (Old Navy ≠ Banana Republic)
- Prevents duplication (shared platform, not 4 separate AI teams)
- Enables learning (Old Navy success → Athleta can replicate)
- Reduces risk (Office of AI provides guardrails, brands execute)

---

### Operations-First Approach

**Learning from retail AI failures** (Amazon Just Walk Out, Taco Bell Voice AI):

**Year 1**: Internal-facing AI (low brand safety risk, clear ROI)
- Inventory forecasting (Old Navy)
- Store associate AI assistant (Gap)
- Markdown optimization (Banana Republic)

**Year 2**: Scale to all brands + corporate functions
- Store manager dashboards
- Supply chain visibility
- HR onboarding automation
- Trend forecasting

**Year 3**: Customer-facing AI (after operations proven)
- Sizing recommendations
- Product design acceleration
- Personalized shopping

**Why Operations-First**:
- Clear cost savings (inventory waste, markdown waste, labor reallocation)
- Less brand safety risk (internal-facing, no customer exposure)
- Builds internal confidence (prove AI works before customer-facing)
- Aligns with CEO priority (operational efficiency, cost controls)

---

### Three Core Principles

**1. AI as Amplification, Not Replacement**
- Store associates: AI frees up time for customers (not replaces associates)
- Merchandisers: AI provides decision support (not replaces judgment)
- Store managers: AI provides insights (not replaces leadership)

**2. Human-in-the-Loop for High-Stakes Decisions**
- Merchandiser can override AI forecast
- Store associate can escalate to manager
- AI recommends, humans decide

**3. One Agentic System, Not 100 Tools**
- Consolidate 200+ AI models into Gemini Enterprise
- Core capabilities: research, architecture, build, validate, monitor
- Serves multiple personas (store associates, managers, merchandisers, corporate)
- Auto-improves with usage (not static tools)

---

### 3-Year Financial Summary

| Year | Investment | Benefit (Conservative) | ROI | Cumulative Benefit |
|------|------------|----------------------|-----|-------------------|
| **Year 1** | $1.6M-$1.7M | $3.75M-$6.5M | 120-280% | $3.75M-$6.5M |
| **Year 2** | $3.2M-$3.5M | $16.75M-$28.5M | 380-715% | $20.5M-$35M |
| **Year 3** | $2.4M-$2.6M | $17.4M-$30M | 570-1,050% | $37.9M-$65M |
| **3-Year Total** | **$7.2M-$7.8M** | **$37.9M-$65M** | **430-730%** | **$37.9M-$65M** |

**The Narrative**: "We invested $1.6M and reduced costs by $5M → request $3.2M for Year 2 → request $2.4M for Year 3 because we built one agentic system, not 100 tools. Budget shrinks because we did it right."

---

### Retail Comparables (Proof It Works)

- **Walmart**: 30% logistics savings, 20% productivity boost ($500M investment)
- **Zara**: 85% sell-through at full price (vs. 70-75% industry average)
- **Perry Ellis**: 95% SKU launch time reduction, 25% conversion increase
- **LVMH**: 40K employees using AI, 2M+ monthly requests

**Gap Advantage**: Similar results at 1/65th Walmart's cost (FDE model vs. platform build)

---

### Failure Cost (What If We Don't Do This?)

**Competitive Risk**: Walmart, Target, LVMH, Zara already deployed AI at scale
**Talent Risk**: Can't attract/retain AI talent, fall behind in AI maturity
**Strategic Risk**: Fail to deliver on CEO Dickson's "digital-first" vision

**Total Failure Cost**: $60M-$120M/year (inventory waste, productivity loss, competitive disadvantage)

**Risk-Adjusted Decision**: Investing $1.6M to avoid $60M-$120M/year loss is a no-brainer

---

## THE RISKS (1 PAGE)

### 5 Risk Categories + Mitigation

**1. Brand Safety Risks** (customer-facing AI damages reputation)
- **Mitigation**: Operations-first (internal-facing Year 1), content guardrails, red-team testing, human review
- **Example**: Avoid Taco Bell Voice AI mistake (accents, edge cases, viral failures)

**2. Operational Risks** (AI decisions cause business disruptions)
- **Mitigation**: Human-in-the-loop, A/B testing, rollback procedures, baseline snapshots
- **Example**: Avoid Amazon Just Walk Out mistake (tracking failures, 1,000 manual verifiers)

**3. Compliance & Privacy Risks** (CCPA, GDPR, PCI violations)
- **Mitigation**: PII/compliance triage, privacy-by-design, quarterly audits, bias detection
- **Example**: Avoid data breach or discriminatory outcomes

**4. Employee Trust Risks** (automation anxiety, surveillance concerns)
- **Mitigation**: "AI as amplification, not replacement" narrative, 5-minute recipes, champions program, opt-in adoption
- **Example**: Avoid 45% staff pushback (tools increasing "time-to-done" get ignored)

**5. Financial Risks** (ROI not materializing, budget overruns)
- **Mitigation**: Phased investment, kill criteria (if ROI not proven in 12 weeks, kill), conservative estimates
- **Example**: Avoid 80-95% AI project failure rate (no clear metrics, governance)

---

### The "No" Framework (When to Kill)

**Kill if** (after 12-week pilot):
- No measurable improvement (baseline metrics unchanged or worse)
- Behavior change not happening (employees not using AI, DAU/WAU <80%)
- ROI negative or unclear (benefits <50% of projected)
- Risk too high (brand safety, compliance, operational risk unmitigated)
- Business unit not engaged (no executive sponsor, no champions)

**Mical's "No" Framework**: Kill bad ideas (AI replacing employees, black box AI, forced adoption, tool sprawl, vendor hype)

---

### Governance Model (Hybrid: Central + Federated)

**AI Governance Committee** (quarterly):
- Chair: Mical Neill
- Members: CTO Sven Gerjets, CIO, Chief Risk Officer, Legal/Compliance, Brand Leaders, CFO
- Responsibilities: Approve platform decisions, review high-risk use cases, set AI standards

**Decision Rights**:
- Platform decisions: Office of AI (centralized)
- Use case decisions: Brand leaders (federated)
- Risk/compliance: Office of AI enables, brands execute

**Escalation Path** (4 levels):
- Level 1: FDE / Brand AI Champion (low-risk, day-to-day)
- Level 2: Mical (medium-risk, cross-brand conflicts)
- Level 3: Governance Committee (high-risk, ONE-WAY DOOR decisions)
- Level 4: Board / CEO (critical incidents, brand safety breaches)
