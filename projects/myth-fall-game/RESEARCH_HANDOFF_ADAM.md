**Date**: 2026-01-26  
**Researcher**: Argentavis (Argy) via Kiro  
**For**: Adam Neill  
**Status**: AWAITING VERIFICATION

## What Was Researched

**Original Request**: Find mythical character games with power progression and magic systems. Assess their popularity and technical sophistication to gauge difficulty for Mythfall development.

**Goal**: Understand if popular mythical games require heavy engineering, or if simpler approaches can succeed.

---

## Key Findings Summary

### AAA Games (High Engineering Complexity)

**Black Myth: Wukong**
- Budget: $70-75M
- Team: Game Science (6-year development)
- Sales: ~$1B revenue, 2.1M concurrent Steam players
- Tech: Unreal Engine 5, photorealistic

**Genshin Impact / Honkai: Star Rail**
- Revenue: $1.71B+ combined (2023)
- Players: 30M+ monthly active
- Tech: AAA production, massive teams

**Elden Ring**
- Sales: 30M+ copies
- Tech: FromSoftware, large team, high complexity

---

### Indie Games (Low-Medium Complexity)

**Hades** (Supergiant Games)
- Team: **20 core people**
- Sales: 1M+ copies
- Awards: Game of the Year 2020
- Tech: 2D isometric, stylized art
- Complexity: MEDIUM

**Dead Cells** (Motion Twin)
- Team: Small worker cooperative
- Tech: 2D roguelite
- Complexity: LOW-MEDIUM
- Success: Critical acclaim

**Slay the Spire** (MegaCrit)
- Team: Very small indie
- Tech: Card-based, minimal graphics
- Complexity: LOW
- Success: Genre-defining indie hit

---

## Key Patterns Discovered

1. **Small teams CAN succeed with mythical themes**
   - Hades: 20 people → Game of the Year
   - Proves you don't need AAA scale

2. **Engineering complexity ≠ Success**
   - Hades beat AAA competitors with smaller team
   - Strong design > massive budget

3. **The "Sweet Spot" exists**
   - Medium complexity + strong design works
   - Stylized art reduces team size needs
   - Roguelike structure = replayability without massive content

4. **Mythical themes work at all scales**
   - AAA: Genshin, Elden Ring, Black Myth
   - Indie: Hades, Dead Cells

## Verification Questions for Adam

**Please answer these before we proceed with Mythfall planning:**

### About Team Size & Complexity

1. Did you understand that Hades (a GOTY winner) was made by only 20 people? Does this change your sense of what's achievable?

2. Does the pattern "small team + strong design > large team + weak design" match your intuition?

3. Are you surprised that Black Myth: Wukong cost $70M but Hades (also mythical/powers/magic) succeeded at indie scale?

---

### About Engineering Complexity

4. Does it make sense that 2D/stylized games (like Hades) require less engineering than photorealistic 3D (like Black Myth)?

5. Do you see roguelike/roguelite structure as a way to get replayability without building massive amounts of content?

6. Does the Vultr/Godot stack you researched align better with the "Hades model" or the "Genshin model"?

---

### About Mythfall's Position

7. Based on this research, do you think Mythfall should aim for:
   - [ ] AAA-scale (Genshin/Black Myth) = hundreds of people, $50M+
   - [ ] Mid-tier (Hades-like) = 20-person team, indie budget
   - [ ] Micro-indie (Slay the Spire) = 2-5 people, minimal budget

8. Does multiplayer change your answer to #7? (Does adding multiplayer make small-team development impossible?)

---

### About What Success Looks Like

9. Which of these games' success would you consider "good enough" for Mythfall:
   - [ ] Hades: 1M+ copies, GOTY, critical acclaim
   - [ ] Dead Cells: Strong indie success, cult following
   - [ ] Slay the Spire: Genre-defining, modest scale

10. Is your goal to build something that:
    - [ ] Competes with Genshin/Elden Ring (mass market, AAA)
    - [ ] Matches Hades (indie hit, critical darling)
    - [ ] Proves the Palette system works (success = functional, not necessarily massive sales)

---

### About Next Research

11. Do you need more information on:
    - [ ] How multiplayer affects small-team complexity?
    - [ ] Specific examples of small-team multiplayer mythical games?
    - [ ] Art style options that reduce engineering load?
    - [ ] None of the above - this research answered your questions

12. Should I search for "successful small-team multiplayer games with mythical themes" specifically?

---

## What Happens Next

**Once you answer these questions:**

1. Mical and Kiro will review your answers
2. We'll determine if more research is needed
3. We'll use this to inform Mythfall's technical approach
4. We'll align on realistic scope and team size

**No decisions will be made until you verify what we learned.**
