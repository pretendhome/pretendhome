## Agentic Concentration Analysis

### RIUs with Highest % Agentic-Native Companies

1. **RIU-510: Multi-Agent Coordination** - 80% agentic-native
   - Pattern: Multi-step reasoning, tool orchestration
   - Companies: LangChain, Fixie.ai, Dust, Relevance AI, Lindy.ai

2. **RIU-511: Agent Task Decomposition** - 40% agentic-native
   - Pattern: Breaking complex tasks into subtasks
   - Companies: Bardeen, Lindy.ai, Mem

3. **RIU-001: Convergence Brief** - 30% agentic-native
   - Pattern: Research, synthesis, knowledge organization
   - Companies: Perplexity AI, Mem, Glean (adding agents)

4. **RIU-040: Code Generation** - 20% agentic-native
   - Pattern: Context-aware code completion and generation
   - Companies: Cursor (moving toward agents), Replit

### RIUs with Low Agentic Adoption (Traditional AI)

1. **RIU-060: Document Understanding** - 5% agentic-native
   - Pattern: Single-task extraction, not multi-step
   - Opportunity: Could shift to agents for complex document workflows

2. **RIU-200: Customer Problem Narrative** - 10% agentic-native
   - Pattern: Analysis and insights, not autonomous action
   - Opportunity: Sales agents emerging (outbound automation)

3. **RIU-122: Batch Pipeline Safety** - 0% agentic-native
   - Pattern: Monitoring and alerting, not autonomous
   - Opportunity: Self-healing pipelines could use agents

### Key Insight: Agent-Suitable Problem Patterns

**Agentic-native companies cluster around problems with**:
- Multi-step reasoning requirements
- Tool use and API orchestration
- Personalization and context adaptation
- Research and synthesis tasks
- Workflow automation across systems

**Traditional AI dominates problems with**:
- Single-task execution (classification, extraction)
- Monitoring and observability (passive)
- Analysis and insights (not action)
- Batch processing (not interactive)

**Emerging Shift**: Traditional AI categories (customer support, sales) are adding agentic capabilities (autonomous actions, not just insights).

## Recommendations for Palette Integration

### 1. YAML Structure
- **Use Option 1** (Use-Case-First Hierarchy) from structure research
- Group companies by use case, then RIU
- Include `agentic_native` flag for every company
- Add `market_validation` score for every RIU

### 2. Teaching Integration
- **Hot RIUs** (top 10) should be featured in interview scenarios
- **Gap RIUs** should be discussed as white space opportunities
- **Agentic concentration** should inform "what problems are good for agents?"

### 3. Demo Scenarios
- **Scenario 1**: Customer support automation (RIU-050) - Show 20+ companies, discuss differentiation
- **Scenario 2**: Agentic workflow orchestration (RIU-510) - Show emerging category, discuss risks

### 4. Palette Positioning
- **RIU-001, RIU-003, RIU-290** are GAP RIUs where Palette operates
- This is FDE/consulting space, not productized yet
- Opportunity: Palette could be the product layer for FDE workflows

## Data Quality Notes

**Baseline Confidence**: MEDIUM
- Company counts: HIGH confidence (well-known companies)
- Funding amounts: MEDIUM confidence (public data, may be outdated)
- Agentic-native classifications: MEDIUM confidence (based on public descriptions)
- RIU mappings: MEDIUM confidence (inferred from problem patterns)

**Perplexity Validation Needed**:
- Confirm funding amounts (especially 2024-2026 rounds)
- Add missing companies (especially YC recent batches, stealth companies)
- Validate agentic-native classifications
- Update with 2025-2026 companies

**Next Steps**:
1. Run Perplexity queries q4-q12
2. Merge Perplexity results with baseline
3. Build final YAML library
4. Create teaching materials

3. **Differentiation**: "20+ companies do customer support AI. How do you differentiate?" → Discuss positioning
4. **Risk assessment**: "What are the risks of building in an emerging category?" → Show RIU-510 (agentic) vs RIU-050 (mature)
