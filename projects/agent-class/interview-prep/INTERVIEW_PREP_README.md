## Interview Kickstart Methodology

**Problem-Solution-Impact Framework** (not just STAR):
- Problem: What was broken/inefficient/risky?
- Solution: What YOU specifically did (not "we")
- Impact: Quantified business outcome (%, $, time saved)
- Learning: What you'd do differently

**7 Behavioral Categories:**
1. Leadership & Influence
2. Problem Solving & Decision Making
3. Communication & Stakeholder Management
4. Technical Depth & System Design
5. Conflict Resolution & Difficult Conversations
6. Innovation & Risk Taking
7. Results & Impact Measurement

**Technical Prep:**
- System design scenarios (whiteboard-ready)
- Trade-off analysis frameworks
- Build vs. buy decision frameworks

**Mock Interview Practice:**
- 2-minute rule (answer in <2 min, then expand if asked)
- Pause-and-pivot technique
- Record yourself, iterate
