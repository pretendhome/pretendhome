  PHASE 2: REX (ARCHITECTURE) - Strategy & Learning Path
======================================================================

🏗️  Analyzing top roles and creating action plan...

**STRATEGY (Next 30 Days)**
1. **Apply immediately**: Anthropic FDE (95 fit), Scale AI Solutions Architect (92 fit), Databricks TPM (90 fit)
2. **Skill gap to address**: Production deployment case studies - document 2-3 examples from AWS work where you deployed agentic systems at scale. Create a "deployment portfolio" showing before/after metrics.
3. **Network move**: Reach out to Anthropic employees on LinkedIn (search "Anthropic Forward Deployed Engineer"). Mention Palette Framework as proof of agentic systems expertise. Target: 3 conversations in next 2 weeks.

**LEARNING PATH (Priority Order)**
- **Solutions Architecture storytelling**: Why needed → Roles emphasize "translating technical to business." How to learn → Practice the "3-minute technical demo" format. Record yourself explaining Palette to a non-technical audience. Refine until clear.
- **Production deployment metrics**: Why needed → Interviewers will ask "tell me about a time you deployed AI at scale." How to learn → Document AWS deployments with metrics (users, accuracy, cost savings). Create 3 STAR-format stories.
- **Company-specific AI knowledge**: Why needed → Each company has unique AI positioning (Anthropic = safety, Scale = data, Databricks = platform). How to learn → Read each company's blog (2-3 recent posts), understand their AI narrative, tailor your pitch.

**APPLICATION PRIORITY**
- Tier 1 (Apply this week): Anthropic FDE, Scale AI Solutions Architect, Databricks TPM
- Tier 2 (Apply next week): Palantir FDE (if willing to relocate), Glean AI Outcomes Manager (if interested in CS hybrid)

**RISK ASSESSMENT**
- Primary risk: "Forward Deployed Engineer" title is new to you - interviewers may probe depth of customer-facing deployment experience. Mitigation: Frame AWS TPM work as "deployment enablement" and emphasize Palette as proof of hands-on building.
- Secondary risk: Compensation expectations ($200K+ total comp) may be at top of band for some roles. Mitigation: Lead with value (agentic AI expertise is rare), negotiate equity if base is lower.

- Technical: 80% (Technical depth is strong, but role is more about customer success metrics than deep technical work. May feel under-utilized.)
- Culture Fit: 82% (Glean values "customer obsession + technical credibility" - good fit, but role is more reactive than proactive. Ensure you're comfortable with CS positioning.)
- **OVERALL**: 84%

Reasoning: Moderate fit with positioning risk. Knowledge architecture + RAG expertise is directly applicable to Glean's AI search platform, but "Outcomes Manager" role is more customer success than technical leadership. Compensation is competitive, but may feel like a step back from TPM. Moderate probability of interview, high probability of offer if you're interested in CS hybrid role.

**Palantir - Forward Deployed Engineer (AI/ML)**
- Resume Screen: 82% (Good match on customer-facing + AI/ML, but Palantir FDE role is notoriously demanding. Multilingual skills are valuable for European deployments.)
- Phone Screen: 85% (Strong technical communication, but Palantir culture is intense. Expect probing questions on "why Palantir" and willingness to work long hours.)

- Culture Fit: 75% (Palantir culture is high-pressure, mission-driven, and requires willingness to travel/relocate. DC location may not be ideal. Ensure you're comfortable with intensity.)
- **OVERALL**: 82%

Reasoning: Moderate fit with culture risk. Technical skills are strong, multilingual abilities are valuable, but Palantir culture is notoriously intense. FDE role requires long hours, frequent travel, and high-pressure customer engagements. Location (DC) may not align with SF Bay Area preference. Moderate probability of interview, moderate probability of offer depending on culture fit assessment.
