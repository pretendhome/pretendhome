🎧 MQ × Tie One Podcast Plan

Working Title: After Hours @ Rossi
(Feels culture-native, reusable for future drops, not campaign-branded)

1️⃣ PLATFORM RECOMMENDATION
Short Evaluation
Instagram Live

Reach

Graffiti community → HIGH

Collectors → MED

Streetwear → HIGH

Social justice → MED

Pros

Already where audience is

Feels raw + authentic

Same as above but with permanence

Cons

Slightly more production effort

Riverside / Zencastr → Multi Distribution

Reach

Balanced across all segments

Pros

Clean audio

One recording → everywhere

Future scalable

Cons

Slight learning curve

Spotify / Apple Only

Not ideal as primary

Graffiti culture is visual + personality driven

Hard to build audience from zero

TikTok Live

Use only as clip distribution
Too shallow for story depth.

✅ PRIMARY STRATEGY (Recommended)
🎯 HYBRID LOW-BUDGET VIDEO PODCAST

Record ONCE → Distribute Everywhere

Record remotely or in gallery using:

Phone camera (iPhone quality is fine)

One good mic

Good lighting

Then distribute:

Full episode → YouTube

Audio → Spotify + Apple

Clips → IG Reels + TikTok

Live moment → IG Live (select episodes only)

💰 Cost (Realistic)

Minimum viable setup

Lavalier mic (Rode SmartLav or similar) → ~$70

Small ring light → ~$40

Tripod → ~$25

👉 Total: ~$135 one-time

Optional upgrade later:

USB mic (Blue Yeti / Samson Q2U) → ~$80-120

Why This Wins

✔ Culture-authentic (not overproduced)
✔ Discoverable forever
✔ Enables clip economy
✔ Scales into future Rossi series
✔ Works if MQ remote OR in person
