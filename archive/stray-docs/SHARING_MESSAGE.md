## Short Version (Email/Slack)

```
Hey! I'm sharing Palette - an AI agent toolkit with constraint enforcement.

Extract the ZIP, open it in Claude/Cursor/any AI, and type "start" for a 
15-minute interactive onboarding.

It'll show you agents that actually enforce their own boundaries (not just 
prompt engineering).

Let me know what you think!
```

## Medium Version (With Context)

```
I wanted to share Palette with you - it's an AI agent toolkit I've been 
working on that solves the "agents doing whatever they want" problem.

The key insight: agents need hard constraints, not just prompts. Palette 
has 7 specialized agents (research, architect, builder, debugger, etc.) 
that enforce their own boundaries.

To try it:
1. Extract palette-toolkit-v1.0.zip
2. Open the palette/ folder in Claude, Cursor, or any AI
3. Type "start" for a 15-minute interactive onboarding

The onboarding will show you live demos of agents refusing out-of-scope 
requests and routing to the right agent instead.

Takes 15 minutes to see it in action. Let me know what you think!
```

## Long Version (With Technical Details)

```
I'm sharing Palette - an AI agent toolkit that turns AI from a chatbot 
into a reliable field partner through bounded agents and constraint 
enforcement.

THE PROBLEM:
Most "agents" fail because they don't manage decisions properly. They 
make architecture commitments silently, build without specs, and expand 
scope without asking.

THE SOLUTION:
Palette uses a three-tier system:
- Tier 1: Immutable rules (convergence before execution, ONE-WAY DOOR pausing)
- Tier 2: Agent definitions (7 agents with hard constraints)
- Tier 3: Execution log (restartable decision ledger)

WHAT'S INCLUDED:
- 7 specialized agents (research, architect, builder, debugger, narrative, validator, monitor)
- 104 RIUs (Reusable Intervention Units - problem patterns)
- 86-question knowledge library
- Full documentation and demo

TO TRY IT:
1. Extract palette-toolkit-v1.0.zip
2. Open palette/ folder in Claude, Cursor, Kiro CLI, or any AI
3. Type "start" for interactive onboarding (15 minutes)

The onboarding shows live demos of:
- Argy (research agent) refusing to make architecture decisions
- Rex (architect) flagging ONE-WAY DOOR decisions and pausing for approval
- Theri (builder) refusing to build without a clear spec

It's not prompt engineering - it's enforced at the agent level.

Takes 15 minutes to see it work. Would love your feedback!
