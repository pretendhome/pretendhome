Anchor Story: Enabling Sellers to Use AI to Perform, Not Just Consume Content
Problem

When I stepped into AWS Enablement, the infrastructure was fragmented and top-down:

Static HQ pages

Mass email notifications

Broad sessions pushed to everyone

Multiple tools (QuickSuite, Kiro, internal research systems) with no coherent adoption path

Sellers stigmatized as “not technical enough” or “not adapting fast enough”

At the same time:

Compensation required precise form submission.

Sales plays required tight narrative rehearsal.

New products were launching weekly.

AI tools existed, but sellers were hesitant to use them.

The gap wasn’t model capability.
It was confidence, clarity, and relevance.

Leadership was pushing AI adoption.
Sellers were overwhelmed.

Solution

I shifted enablement from broadcast to behavior change.

1. I started with sellers, not tools.
I met directly with PMs responsible for different sales motions.
I mapped:

SPIFs and compensation incentives

Required internal forms

Sales play documentation flows

GEO and POD-specific motions

Then I built enablement tied to their real incentives:

How to fill forms correctly to receive full compensation

How to rehearse pitches using AI before customer calls

How to generate elevator narratives tied to specific sales motions

2. I built agentic workflows before asking anyone else to use them.

Before broad rollout:

I automated my own reporting pipeline.

Built GEO + Job Title + Sales Play analytics breakdowns.

Created internal retrieval flows to generate contextualized enablement summaries.

Used research agents to audit relevance and source citation quality.

Identified impression bias in outputs and improved vector retrieval strategy.

I never asked sellers to adopt something I hadn’t pressure-tested in production myself.

3. I reduced fear through 5-minute “recipes.”

AI adoption wasn’t blocked by intelligence.
It was blocked by hesitation.

So I built short, repeatable demos:

“How to generate a sales play narrative in 5 minutes.”

“How to audit your form submission before sending.”

“How to use Kiro to rehearse a pitch.”

These weren’t theoretical.
They were live workflows sellers could copy immediately.

Adoption shifted from abstract AI to usable workflows.

4. I moved from mass promotion to targeted activation.

Instead of pushing every session to everyone:

I targeted specific PODs.

Customized Slack channels.

Narrowed enablement to cohort-specific needs.

Coordinated QuickSuite and Kiro messaging per use case.

Not everyone needed everything.
Each group needed something specific.

5. I reframed executive perception.

There was a narrative circulating that:

“Sellers don’t know how to sell when it’s not easy.”

I disagreed with that framing.

What I saw:

Intelligent operators navigating fragmented systems.

Incentives misaligned with enablement structure.

Fear of new AI tools without safe practice environments.

I humanized adoption:

Joined cross-org meetings.

Demonstrated AI live.

Assumed high intelligence in stakeholders.

Removed stigma by making usage normal.

Impact

Within the Improve Plan period alone:

+17% attendance increase (153 → 179 avg/session)

+50% increase in high-CSAT sessions (>4.9)

+67% increase in sales plays covered (133 → 222)

Distribution infrastructure migrated to Zoom webinar

Calendar holds eliminated

Interactive HQ navigation deployed

Automated analytics pipeline built

More importantly:

Sellers stopped asking:

“What is this tool?”

They started asking:

“Can this help me win this deal?”

That shift is behavior change.
Not just enablement metrics.

Why This Maps to the Gap Role

This story shows:

You enabled non-technical users to adopt AI confidently.

You built systems that scaled across GEOs, roles, and sales motions.

You said “no” to mass broadcast and built a better targeted path.

You reframed ROI from “AI adoption” to “compensation accuracy and deal readiness.”

You operationalized agentic systems before evangelizing them.

This isn’t theory.
You already did the work.
