CURRENT ROLE (MOST IMPORTANT SECTION)

Job Title

Senior Technical Program Manager, AI Strategy & Enterprise Enablement

If system forces custom title:

Agentic AI Enablement Systems Architect

Why this is optimal

“Senior TPM” anchors you in a known ladder

“AI Strategy” signals ownership above execution

“Enterprise Enablement” matches internal-platform language

“Agentic” is modern but not hypey

Role Description (FINAL VERSION)

Define strategy, prioritization, and delivery for AI-driven enterprise enablement initiatives spanning employee-facing platforms and internal productivity tools.

Partner with Technology, Data, Product, Legal, and Business Operations to move initiatives from opportunity framing through pilot, measurement, and enterprise-scale rollout. Develop business cases, success metrics, and executive communications to drive alignment, adoption, and measurable impact across distributed teams.

Why this is perfect

No internal AWS jargon

Clear strategy → execution arc

If a hiring manager reads only this form, they will understand:

what you do

why you matter

how you operate

where you’re strongest

If you want, next we can:

generate a single master Workday profile you reuse everywhere

create a startup/FDE variant (very different emphasis)

or prep interview narratives that map 1:1 to these fields

This is submission-ready.
