**What it is**: A three-tier agent system that routes problems through a taxonomy (104 RIUs) to specialized agents with proven solutions and GTM knowledge. Built over 2.5 years at AWS.

**What it does**: Classifies your problem → Routes to appropriate agent → Agent retrieves proven patterns → Builds solution → Learns from success/failure
