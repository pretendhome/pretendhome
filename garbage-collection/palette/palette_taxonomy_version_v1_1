palette_taxonomy_version: v1.1
generated_at: '2025-01-21'

changelog:
  v1.1:
    - Added 8 agent archetypes (including Ankylosaurus/Validator and Parasaurolophus/Monitor)
    - Added RIU-500 series (Multimodal AI Workflows - 4 RIUs)
    - Added RIU-510 series (Advanced Agentic Systems - 5 RIUs)
    - Added RIU-520 series (Modern LLMOps - 5 RIUs)
    - Added RIU-530 series (AI Governance - 6 RIUs)
    - Added RIU-540 series (Agent-Specific Patterns - 4 RIUs)
    - Updated agent_types across all RIUs to include new archetypes where applicable
    - Total RIUs: 111 (original 87 + 24 new)

principles:
  - RIUs are inert execution materials; they do not route, orchestrate, or track usage
  - Coordinates are soft anchors (search/narrowing aids), not constraints
  - Reversibility is explicit (two_way | one_way | mixed)
  - Agents are referenced by type only; behavior lives in Assumptions layer
  - Multiple RIUs may apply; "no match" is valid and surfaces gaps
  - The taxonomy is a routing table that maps tasks to agents
