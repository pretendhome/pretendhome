  question: How do I force convergence when stakeholders have conflicting definitions
    of success?
  answer: Create a Convergence Brief (RIU-001) requiring written commitment to Goal,
    Roles, Constraints, Capabilities, and Non-goals. Use Stakeholder Map + RACI-lite
    (RIU-002) to identify decision authority by influence and interest, then develop
    tailored engagement strategies. Secure executive sponsorship (CIO/CFO level) early
    — involvement should correlate with investment size and cross-team dependencies.
    Facilitate a cross-functional workshop where stakeholders must agree on measurable
    success criteria before proceeding. Err toward higher risk ratings initially,
    refine through discussion. Establish "people champions" to drive alignment, and
    pilot solutions to build consensus through demonstrated success before scaling.
    Document agreed definitions as ONE-WAY DOOR commitments in decisions.md to prevent
    re-litigation.

  question: What's the difference between a ONE-WAY DOOR and TWO-WAY DOOR decision
    in AI system architecture?
  answer: 'ONE-WAY DOOR decisions are difficult or impossible to reverse and require
    human approval before execution — flag these as "🚨 ONE-WAY DOOR — confirmation
    required" and log in decisions.md via RIU-003 (Decision Log + One-Way Door Registry).
    Examples in AI/ML: ethical AI guidelines, data governance frameworks, model architecture
    selection, production deployment commitments, and database schema for ML features.
    TWO-WAY DOOR decisions are easily reversible and support Amazon''s "Bias for Action"
    — agents may proceed autonomously with monitoring. Examples: hyperparameter tuning,
    prompt iterations, A/B test configurations. Key insight: don''t treat AI/ML projects
    as deterministic software; acknowledge uncertainty and establish governance templates
    before implementation. For ONE-WAY DOORs, estimate value of right decisions against
    cost of wrong ones, secure executive sponsorship, and use MLOps assessment to
    ensure architectural decisions support long-term ROI.'

  question: How do I scope an AI pilot when the customer says 'we need AI everywhere'?
  answer: 'Resist technology-first thinking. Use RIU-004 (Problem → Workstream Decomposition)
    to generate broad candidate use cases without committing, then narrow using AWS''s
    Five V''s Framework: Value (high-impact opportunities), Visualize (clear success
    metrics), Validate (test against real requirements), Verify (scalable production
    path), Venture (secure long-term resources). Apply weighted shortest job first
    (WSJF) combined with responsible AI assessment — this may reprioritize projects
    by revealing hidden complexity. Create a Scope Freeze (RIU-005) with Phase 0/1/2
    deliverables: start with prompt engineering for general knowledge tasks, add RAG
    when factual grounding needed. Define explicit Non-goals in your Convergence Brief
    (RIU-001) to prevent "AI everywhere" creep. Select pilots with quality data, engaged
    business sponsors, measurable ROI, and TWO-WAY DOOR characteristics enabling quick
    iteration. Target 3-6 month delivery cycles to build organizational confidence
    before scaling.'

  question: What artifacts prove convergence has been achieved before implementation
    starts?
  answer: 'The Semantic Blueprint (Convergence Brief, RIU-001) is the primary artifact
    — it must contain five elements: Goal (measurable success criteria), Roles (human
    vs agent responsibilities), Capabilities (tools/agents needed), Constraints (binding
    requirements), and Non-goals (explicit exclusions). Supporting artifacts include:
    Stakeholder Map + RACI-lite (RIU-002) showing decision authority and escalation
    paths; Decision Log + One-Way Door Registry (RIU-003) documenting irreversible
    commitments; Success Metrics Charter (RIU-006) with outcome metrics and acceptance
    checks; Assumptions Register (RIU-008) listing testable assumptions with validation
    plans; and Problem → Workstream Decomposition (RIU-004) showing candidate RIUs
    without premature commitment. Per AWS CAF AI, also document ethical AI guidelines,
    data governance approach, and risk evaluation. Convergence is proven when stakeholders
    have signed off on these artifacts and no open questions block implementation.
    Store in decisions.md for restartability.'

  question: How do I handle requirements that change weekly in an enterprise AI deployment?
  answer: 'Distinguish between TWO-WAY DOOR changes (reversible — absorb quickly)
    and ONE-WAY DOOR changes (irreversible — require formal re-convergence via RIU-001).
    Implement a federated operating model: central oversight for data access, model
    risk, and compliance, while lines of business iterate autonomously within defined
    boundaries. Use the Assumptions Register (RIU-008) to track volatile requirements
    as testable assumptions with expiry dates rather than fixed specs. Apply AI-DLC
    methodology with structured prompts and mob elaboration to move from requirements
    to working prototypes in hours, enabling rapid validation before commitment. Map
    organizational debt and streamline approval processes that hinder adaptation.
    Redefine the Convergence Brief (RIU-001) as a living document — freeze ONE-WAY
    DOORs (architecture, data schema, compliance) while allowing TWO-WAY DOORs (prompts,
    UI, thresholds) to evolve weekly. Key insight: AI systems are nondeterministic,
    requiring new trust models where "requirements" become hypotheses validated through
    continuous experimentation rather than upfront specifications.'

  question: What's the minimum viable convergence brief for a 2-week AI proof of concept?
  answer: "Even a 2-week PoC requires all five Semantic Blueprint elements (RIU-001),\
    \ but scoped minimally:\n      \n      **Goal**: One measurable outcome (e.g.,\
    \ \"80% accuracy on 50 test cases\" or \"< 3s latency at < $0.02/request\").\n\
    \      **Roles**: One human sponsor + one technical lead — skip full RACI.\n \
    \     **Capabilities**: Single AI capability being validated (e.g., \"Document\
    \ classification via Bedrock Claude\").\n      **Constraints**: Hard boundaries\
    \ — budget cap, data restrictions, no production deployment, token limits.\n \
    \     **Non-goals**: 2-3 explicit exclusions to prevent scope creep.\n      \n\
    \      Per AWS guidance, add **exit criteria** with specific thresholds for quality,\
    \ latency, and cost — know when to pivot or stop. Validate only core components\
    \ before full integration to isolate failure points. Track unit economics early\
    \ (per-request cost, token usage, compute). Document ethical AI considerations\
    \ even for short pilots. Use ONE-WAY DOOR check: if PoC requires irreversible\
    \ decisions (data grants, vendor commits), get sign-off first. Brief should fit\
    \ one page — if not, you're overscoping."

  question: How do I identify when a customer request is actually 3 separate problems
    disguised as one?
  answer: "**Warning signs of bundled problems:**\n      - Vague objectives like \"\
    improve productivity\" or \"add AI\" (no specific metric)\n      - Different stakeholders\
    \ define success differently for the same request\n      - No clear line of sight\
    \ from proposed feature to measurable business outcome\n      - Request spans\
    \ multiple data domains, teams, or systems\n      - Cannot answer \"how will we\
    \ measure success?\" with one metric\n      \n      **Decomposition technique:**\
    \ Use RIU-004 (Problem → Workstream Decomposition) to generate broad candidate\
    \ workstreams without committing. Apply the AIR Workshop methodology: score each\
    \ potential use case (1-10) on business impact, cost, implementation complexity,\
    \ business priority, and timeline. Plot on Eisenhower matrix to separate high-impact\
    \ use cases from quick wins. Each decomposed problem must have its own line of\
    \ sight to specific, quantifiable metrics (e.g., \"reduce churn 5%\" not \"improve\
    \ customer experience\").\n      \n      **Validation test:** If a problem requires\
    \ its own Convergence Brief (RIU-001) with distinct Goal, Constraints, and Stakeholders\
    \ — it's a separate problem. Document in decisions.md and negotiate phased delivery\
    \ (RIU-005) rather than one mega-project."

  question: What questions surface hidden constraints that will block AI deployment
    later?
  answer: "Ask these questions during discovery and document answers in your Constraint\
    \ Profile (RIU-007):\n      \n      **Regulatory & Compliance:**\n      - Which\
    \ regulations apply? (EU AI Act, GDPR, HIPAA, CCPA, SOX, FedRAMP)\n      - Is\
    \ a Business Associate Addendum (BAA) required? (Healthcare)\n      - What model\
    \ explainability requirements exist? (EU AI Act high-risk systems)\n      - What\
    \ audit trail and traceability requirements apply?\n      \n      **Data & Privacy:**\n\
    \      - Where must data reside? (Sovereignty, cross-border transfer restrictions)\n\
    \      - What PII/PHI handling is required? (Encryption at rest/in transit, anonymization)\n\
    \      - Who owns the training data? Any licensing restrictions?\n      - Can\
    \ data leave the customer's environment for model training/inference?\n      \n\
    \      **Infrastructure & Security:**\n      - What network latency is acceptable?\
    \ (Critical for real-time AI)\n      - What authentication/IAM controls are required?\n\
    \      - Is the model supply chain auditable? (Backdoor/vulnerability risks)\n\
    \      - Is Infrastructure as Code (IaC) required for deployment?\n      \n  \
    \    **Organizational & Procurement:**\n      - How long is legal/security review?\
    \ (Often 4-12 weeks in enterprise)\n      - Are there existing vendor contracts\
    \ that constrain tool selection?\n      - Do unions or workforce agreements affect\
    \ automation deployment?\n      - Is there executive sponsorship aligned with\
    \ legal/compliance/business units?\n      - What team knowledge gaps require training\
    \ before deployment?\n      \n      Flag any answer that implies a ONE-WAY DOOR\
    \ decision (RIU-003). Use RIU-530 (AI Risk Classification) for regulated industries."

  question: How do I document tribal knowledge that exists only in stakeholder heads?
  answer: "**Elicitation techniques:**\n      - Use voice-based capture (Amazon Transcribe\
    \ + Bedrock) — reduces cognitive load and captures natural explanations better\
    \ than asking SMEs to write documentation\n      - Ask scenario-based questions:\
    \ \"Walk me through what you do when X happens\" rather than \"What are the rules\
    \ for X?\"\n      - Probe \"it depends\" answers: \"What specifically does it\
    \ depend on? Give me the last 3 examples\"\n      - Shadow SMEs during real work\
    \ to capture decision-making in context\n      - Use \"teach-back\" validation:\
    \ document your understanding and have SME correct it\n      \n      **4-step\
    \ capture workflow:**\n      1. **Capture**: Record conversations with experienced\
    \ workers (voice preferred)\n      2. **Transcribe**: Convert to structured text\
    \ using Amazon Transcribe\n      3. **Structure**: Use Bedrock to extract decision\
    \ trees, rules, and edge cases\n      4. **Validate**: Review with SME to confirm\
    \ accuracy before finalizing\n      \n      **PALETTE integration:**\n      -\
    \ Store validated rules in Assumptions Register (RIU-008) with testable conditions\n\
    \      - Document decision logic in Decision Log (RIU-003) for future reference\n\
    \      - Feed into Edge-Case Catalog (RIU-014) for testing\n      - Flag assumptions\
    \ that are ONE-WAY DOORs if they drive architecture decisions\n      \n      Critical:\
    \ Capture *why* decisions are made, not just *what* — the reasoning is often more\
    \ valuable than the rule itself."

  question: When should I escalate to reset/reframe vs continue converging?
  answer: "**RESET signals (stop and start over with fresh framing):**\n      - No\
    \ tangible results after agreed timeline (many AI projects abandoned for this)\n\
    \      - Stakeholders still have conflicting definitions of success after 2-3\
    \ alignment attempts\n      - No clear line of sight from AI feature to measurable\
    \ business metric\n      - Technical team owns strategy without cross-functional\
    \ business involvement\n      - Exit criteria thresholds (quality, latency, cost)\
    \ consistently missed\n      \n      **REFRAME signals (change the problem statement,\
    \ keep context):**\n      - Original problem was actually 3 problems disguised\
    \ as one (see LIB-007)\n      - Production reached but scaling challenges emerge\
    \ (load balancing, observability, optimization)\n      - Value chain mapping reveals\
    \ disconnect between feature and business impact\n      - Constraints discovered\
    \ that make original approach infeasible (see LIB-008)\n      \n      **CONTINUE\
    \ CONVERGING when:**\n      - Decisions are TWO-WAY DOORs (reversible, low-cost\
    \ to change)\n      - Governance frameworks in place (user profiles, data access,\
    \ infrastructure templates)\n      - Stakeholders aligned on success criteria,\
    \ just iterating on solution\n      - Progress measurable against agreed milestones\n\
    \      \n      **PALETTE guidance:** If convergence not reached within expected\
    \ exchange window, propose Reset, Fork (try different approach), or Reframe. Silent\
    \ looping is not allowed. Escalate to executive sponsor when reset involves ONE-WAY\
    \ DOOR sunk costs. Document decision in decisions.md with rationale."

  question: How do I create a semantic blueprint that non-technical stakeholders can
    validate?
  answer: "Translate the 5 Semantic Blueprint elements (RIU-001) into business language:\n\
    \      \n      **Goal**: Use OGSM framework — state business outcome, not technical\
    \ metric. Say \"Reduce customer churn by 5%\" not \"Achieve 85% model accuracy.\"\
    \ Avoid vague objectives like \"improve productivity.\"\n      \n      **Roles**:\
    \ Name people and departments, not systems. \"Marketing owns data input; AI team\
    \ owns model; Legal approves before launch\" — skip technical architecture.\n\
    \      \n      **Capabilities**: Describe what the system *does for users*, not\
    \ how it works. \"Automatically flags high-risk accounts for review\" not \"Uses\
    \ gradient boosting classifier.\"\n      \n      **Constraints**: Frame as business\
    \ boundaries. \"Must not access customer PII without consent; Budget capped at\

  question: What's the checklist for 'good enough' convergence before moving to architecture?
  answer: "Use this checklist before proceeding from Convergence to Architecture phase.\
    \ All items should be documented or explicitly marked \"N/A with rationale.\"\n\
    \      \n      **Semantic Blueprint Complete (RIU-001):**\n      - [ ] Goal: Measurable\

  question: What's the best way to model exception-heavy workflows in AI systems?
  answer: "Exception-heavy workflows require a layered architecture that separates\
    \ the \"happy path\" from exception handling:\n      \n      **Architecture pattern:**\n\
    \      1. **Deterministic layer first**: Handle known, rule-based exceptions with\
    \ explicit IF/THEN logic — these are predictable and testable\n      2. **AI layer\
    \ for ambiguity**: Use LLM/agents only for cases that require judgment or context\
    \ understanding\n      3. **Human-in-the-loop escape hatch**: Route unconfident\
    \ or high-stakes exceptions to human review\n      \n      **Design principles:**\n\
    \      - Use adaptive workflows (AI-DLC pattern) that modulate depth based on\
    \ complexity — simple cases get fast path, exceptions get deeper analysis\n  \
    \    - Implement fault isolation: exceptions in one branch shouldn't cascade to\
    \ others\n      - Apply MCP architecture for standardized tool integration across\
    \ exception handlers\n      - Build layered protection based on user personas,\
    \ data characteristics, and failure modes\n      \n      **Exception categorization:**\n\
    \      - **Known exceptions**: Catalog in Edge-Case Catalog (RIU-014), handle\
    \ deterministically\n      - **Unknown-but-bounded**: AI handles within guardrails,\
    \ logs for review\n      - **Unbounded/novel**: Route to human immediately\n \
    \     \n      **Testing strategy:**\n      - Test guardrail effectiveness explicitly\
    \ — inject edge cases and verify behavior\n      - Use reinforcement learning\
    \ in simulated environments (Amazon Nova Act achieves 90%+ reliability this way)\n\
    \      - Validate that exception paths actually execute — dead code is common\
    \ in exception handling\n      \n      **PALETTE integration:**\n      - Document\
    \ exception categories in RIU-014 (Edge-Case Catalog)\n      - Flag exception-handling\
    \ logic that involves ONE-WAY DOOR decisions\n      - Store exception patterns\
    \ in Assumptions Register (RIU-008) for validation\n      \n      Key insight:\
    \ Don't try to handle all exceptions with AI — use AI for judgment, deterministic\
    \ code for known patterns, humans for novel/high-stakes cases."

  question: How do I turn 'we'll know it when we see it' into measurable acceptance
    criteria?
  answer: "\"We'll know it when we see it\" signals subjective quality expectations.\
    \ Use these techniques to make them measurable:\n      \n      **Step 1: Extract\
    \ concrete examples**\n      - Ask: \"Show me 3 examples of good output and 3\
    \ examples of bad output\"\n      - Ask: \"What specifically makes this one good?\
    \ What's missing from the bad one?\"\n      - Document these as your initial Golden\
    \ Set (RIU-021)\n      \n      **Step 2: Apply the 4 evaluation frameworks**\n\
    \      1. **LLM-as-a-Judge**: Use Amazon Bedrock Evaluations with custom metrics\
    \ — define your own criteria alongside built-in metrics\n      2. **Rubric-Based\
    \ Evaluation**: Create scoring rubric (1-5 scale) with explicit criteria for each\
    \ level\n      3. **Traditional Metrics**: Where applicable, add objective measures\
    \ (latency, cost, format compliance)\n      4. **Domain-Specific**: Map to business\
    \ outcomes (response time → resolution rate → customer satisfaction)\n      \n\
    \      **Step 3: Build measurable proxies**\n      For each subjective criterion,\
    \ identify 2-3 quantifiable proxies:\n      - \"Sounds professional\" → No grammar\
    \ errors + formal tone score (LLM-judge) + no slang detected\n      - \"Helpful\
    \ response\" → Contains action items + answers the question asked + user follow-up\
    \ rate\n      - \"Accurate\" → Factual claims verified against source + no hallucinated\
    \ entities + citation coverage\n      \n      **Step 4: Validate with stakeholders**\n\
    \      - Run evaluation on 50+ examples, show results\n      - Ask: \"Does a score\
    \ of 4.2 on this rubric match what you'd call 'good enough'?\"\n      - Adjust\
    \ thresholds until metrics align with human judgment (target ρ > 0.8 correlation)\n\
    \      \n      **PALETTE integration:**\n      - Document criteria in Success\
    \ Metrics Charter (RIU-006)\n      - Store Golden Set in RIU-021 for regression\
    \ testing\n      - Define exit criteria: \"Acceptance requires score ≥ X on rubric\
    \ across Y% of test cases\"\n      \n      Key insight: Evaluation is the single\
    \ most important component for GenAI success — without it, you risk deploying\
    \ models that fail silently."

  question: What prompt engineering patterns work for translating policy documents
    into LLM behavior?
  answer: "Use a layered approach combining prompt structure, guardrails, and validation:\n\
    \      \n      **Prompt structure for policies:**\n      - **System prompt**:\
    \ Set role and global constraints (\"You are a compliance assistant. Never provide\
    \ advice that violates [Policy X].\")\n      - **Context section**: Include relevant\
    \ policy excerpts (use RAG for large policy corpora)\n      - **Instruction**:\
    \ Specific task with policy reference (\"Answer the user's question following\
    \ Section 3.2 guidelines\")\n      - **Constraints**: Explicit prohibitions (\"\
    Do NOT discuss [prohibited topics]. If asked, respond with [approved deflection].\"\
    )\n      - **Examples**: Few-shot samples showing compliant vs. non-compliant\
    \ responses\n      \n      **Parameter settings for compliance:**\n      - Temperature:\
    \ 0.0-0.3 (prioritize consistency over creativity)\n      - Top_p: 0.5-0.7 (restrict\
    \ output variance)\n      - Use deterministic settings for policy-critical responses\n\
    \      \n      **Guardrails layer (Amazon Bedrock Guardrails):**\n      - Content\
    \ filters for harmful/inappropriate content\n      - Denied topics aligned with\
    \ policy prohibitions\n      - Word filters for restricted terminology\n     \
    \ - Sensitive information filters (PII/PHI detection and masking)\n      - IAM\
    \ policy-based enforcement for mandatory guardrails on every inference call\n\
    \      \n      **Validation approach:**\n      - **Positive testing**: Legitimate\
    \ policy-compliant queries pass correctly\n      - **Negative testing**: Prohibited\
    \ content/topics are blocked\n      - Test edge cases where policies conflict\
    \ or are ambiguous\n      - Version control prompts (RIU-520) for audit trail\
    \ and controlled updates\n      \n      **PALETTE integration:**\n      - Document\
    \ policy-to-prompt mapping in RIU-022 (Prompt Interface Contract)\n      - Store\
    \ prompt versions in RIU-520 (Prompt Version Control)\n      - Define guardrail\
    \ requirements in Constraint Profile (RIU-007)\n      - Flag policy interpretations\
    \ that are ONE-WAY DOORs (require legal/compliance sign-off)\n      \n      Key\
    \ insight: Prompts alone aren't sufficient — use Bedrock Guardrails as a defense-in-depth\
    \ layer that enforces policies even if prompts are bypassed or jailbroken."

  question: How do I capture human judgment that's based on years of experience, not
    explicit rules?
  answer: "Experiential judgment is pattern recognition that experts can't articulate\
    \ as rules. Capture it through examples, feedback loops, and calibration — not\
    \ interviews alone.\n      \n      **Elicitation techniques:**\n      - **Case-based\
    \ extraction**: Present real scenarios and ask \"What would you do? Why?\" Record\
    \ decisions, not just rules\n      - **Contrastive pairs**: Show two similar cases\
    \ with different outcomes — \"Why did you handle these differently?\"\n      -\
    \ **Think-aloud protocol**: Have expert narrate while working real cases (use\
    \ voice capture with Transcribe + Bedrock)\n      - **Calibration sessions**:\
    \ Show AI outputs to expert, ask \"Would you have done this?\" — disagreements\
    \ reveal tacit criteria\n      \n      **Learning architectures:**\n      1. **Feedback\
    \ Loop HITL**: Expert reviews AI outputs, corrections feed back into system\n\
    \      2. **RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback)**: Fine-tune models\
    \ using expert preferences on output pairs\n      3. **RLAIF**: When expert time\
    \ is limited, use AI-generated feedback (reduces SME workload ~80%)\n      4.\
    \ **Self-learning system**: Use disagreements between models as learning signals\
    \ (Amazon Catalog pattern — supervisor model resolves conflicts, builds hierarchical\
    \ knowledge base)\n      \n      **AWS tools:**\n      - Amazon SageMaker Ground\
    \ Truth Plus for preference datasets and demonstration data\n      - Amazon Bedrock\
    \ for fine-tuning with human feedback\n      - Amazon Transcribe for voice-based\
    \ knowledge capture\n      \n      **What CAN'T be captured:**\n      - Judgment\
    \ requiring real-time sensory input (smell, touch, visual nuance)\n      - Decisions\
    \ requiring context the system can't access\n      - Novel situations outside\
    \ training distribution\n      - Flag these for permanent human-in-the-loop (Escalation-Based\
    \ HITL pattern)\n      \n      **PALETTE integration:**\n      - Store captured\
    \ judgment patterns in Assumptions Register (RIU-008) as hypotheses to validate\n\
    \      - Document expert disagreements — these reveal edge cases (RIU-014)\n \
    \     - Flag judgment calls that are ONE-WAY DOORs (require human approval even\
    \ after training)\n      \n      Key insight: Don't ask experts to explain rules\
    \ — show them cases and capture their reactions. Judgment lives in the delta between\
    \ what they do and what a naive system would do."

  question: What's the difference between deterministic rules and probabilistic AI
    for business logic?
  answer: "**Deterministic rules (Automated Reasoning):**\n      - Uses formal logic\
    \ and mathematical proofs\n      - 100% accuracy when assumptions are correct\n\
    \      - Outputs: valid / invalid / satisfiable with explanation\n      - Best\
    \ for: yes/no questions, always/never policies, compliance validation\n      -\
    \ Examples: HR policies, regulations, operational workflows, access control\n\
    \      - AWS tool: Automated Reasoning checks in Amazon Bedrock Guardrails (translates\
    \ up to 100-page policy docs into logical models)\n      - Tradeoff: Requires\
    \ well-defined rules; struggles with novel situations; maintenance burden as rules\
    \ multiply\n      \n      **Probabilistic AI (Machine Learning):**\n      - Uses\
    \ statistical patterns from data\n      - Generalized predictions, not 100% accurate\n\
    \      - Outputs: predictions with confidence scores\n      - Best for: pattern\
    \ recognition, unstructured data, complex decisions with many variables\n    \
    \  - Examples: fraud detection, demand forecasting, sentiment analysis, recommendations\n\
    \      - Tradeoff: Less explainable; requires training data; may produce unexpected\
    \ outputs\n      \n      **When to use which:**\n      | Scenario | Use Deterministic\
    \ | Use Probabilistic |\n      |----------|-------------------|-------------------|\n\
    \      | \"Is this allowed by policy?\" | ✅ | |\n      | \"What's the risk score?\"\
    \ | | ✅ |\n      | \"Does this meet compliance?\" | ✅ | |\n      | \"What will\
    \ customer likely do?\" | | ✅ |\n      | \"Is this data valid?\" | ✅ | |\n   \
    \   | \"What's the best response?\" | | ✅ |\n      \n      **Hybrid architecture\
    \ (recommended):**\n      Use RIU-023 (Deterministic-First Pipeline Split):\n\
    \      1. **Deterministic layer first**: Validate inputs, check policy compliance,\
    \ apply business rules\n      2. **Probabilistic layer second**: AI handles ambiguous\
    \ cases, generates content, makes predictions\n      3. **Deterministic guardrails\
    \ around AI**: Validate AI outputs against rules before returning\n      \n  \
    \    Key insight: Deterministic rules tell you what's *allowed*; probabilistic\
    \ AI tells you what's *likely*. Use both — rules as guardrails, AI for judgment."

    \ **Versioning patterns (Amazon DynamoDB):**\n      - **Time-based**: Use timestamp\
    \ in sort key (`rule_id#2024-06-15T10:30:00Z`) — good for audit trails\n     \
    \ - **Number-based**: Use version prefix + atomic counter (`v#0001`, `v#0002`)\
    \ — good for rollback\n      - **Optimistic concurrency**: Include version number\
    \ in writes, reject stale updates — prevents conflicts\n      \n      **Change\
    \ tracking:**\n      - Enable DynamoDB Streams to capture all rule changes\n \
    \     - Lambda function processes stream → logs to audit table, triggers notifications\n\
    \      - Decouples change detection from rule execution\n      \n      **Architecture\
    \ pattern (Step Functions + DynamoDB):**\n      1. API Gateway receives rule update\
    \ request\n      2. Step Functions orchestrates validation → approval → deployment\n\
    \      3. DynamoDB stores rule versions with metadata (author, timestamp, approval\
    \ status)\n      4. Lambda handles audit logging and downstream notifications\n\
    \      \n      **For complex rules engines:**\n      - Store rule definitions\
    \ in Amazon S3 (JSON/YAML files) with S3 versioning enabled\n      - Store rule\
    \ configuration/weights in Amazon Aurora\n      - Store execution results in DynamoDB\n\
    \      - Enables non-technical users to update rules without IT involvement\n\
    \      \n      **CI/CD integration:**\n      - Treat rules as code: store in Git\
    \ repository\n      - PR review for rule changes (especially ONE-WAY DOOR changes)\n\
    \      - Automated testing of rule logic before deployment\n      - API-driven\
    \ deployment to production\n      \n      **PALETTE integration:**\n      - Document\
    \ rule changes in Decision Log (RIU-003) when they affect system behavior\n  \
    \    - Flag rule changes that are ONE-WAY DOORs (compliance rules, pricing logic)\n\
    \      - Use RIU-044 (Business Rules Documentation) for rule catalog\n      -\
    \ Track rule assumptions in Assumptions Register (RIU-008)\n      \n      **Rollback\
    \ strategy:**\n      - Maintain N previous versions (recommend: at least 5)\n\
    \      - Test rollback procedure before you need it\n      - Include rollback\
    \ in incident runbook (RIU-062)\n      \n      Key insight: Version the rule *definition*\
    \ separately from the rule *execution state*. You need to know what rules were\
    \ active at any point in time for audit and debugging."

  question: How do I handle business rules that conflict across departments?
  answer: "Rule conflicts are natural in enterprises — don't try to eliminate tension,\
    \ establish governance to resolve it systematically.\n      \n      **Conflict\
    \ detection:**\n      - Document all rules with owning department and business\
    \ justification\n      - During rule ingestion, check for overlapping conditions\
    \ with different outcomes\n      - Flag conflicts explicitly: \"Rule A (Sales)\
    \ says X; Rule B (Compliance) says Y\"\n      - Store in centralized rule catalog\
    \ (RIU-044) with cross-references\n      \n      **Resolution governance (Hybrid\
    \ CoE model):**\n      - **Executive Sponsor**: Final arbiter for unresolved conflicts\
    \ affecting strategy\n      - **AI Governance Lead**: Day-to-day conflict triage\
    \ and resolution tracking\n      - **Cross-Functional Oversight Team**: Representatives\
    \ from each department evaluate conflicts\n      - Use AIR workshop methodology\
    \ when prioritization disputes arise\n      \n      **Priority framework:**\n\
    \      1. **Regulatory/Compliance rules** → Always highest priority (non-negotiable)\n\
    \      2. **Security/Safety rules** → Second priority\n      3. **Customer-facing\
    \ rules** → Third priority\n      4. **Operational efficiency rules** → Lowest\
    \ priority, most negotiable\n      \n      Document priority hierarchy in Constraint\
    \ Profile (RIU-007) and get executive sign-off.\n      \n      **Resolution patterns:**\n\
    \      - **Scope separation**: Rules apply to different contexts (e.g., \"Sales\
    \ rule for prospects, Compliance rule for regulated customers\")\n      - **Time-based\
    \ precedence**: Newer rule supersedes unless explicitly versioned\n      - **Escalation**:\
    \ Use \"Disagree and Commit\" — debate respectfully, then fully commit to decision\n\
    \      - **Merge**: Create unified rule that satisfies both intents\n      \n\
    \      **Technical implementation:**\n      - Implement rule priority field (integer)\
    \ in rule schema\n      - When conflicts detected at runtime, highest priority\
    \ wins\n      - Log all conflict resolutions for audit trail\n      - Alert when\
    \ new rules create conflicts with existing rules\n      \n      **PALETTE integration:**\n\
    \      - Document conflict resolutions in Decision Log (RIU-003) as they're often\
    \ ONE-WAY DOORs\n      - Track unresolved conflicts in Open Questions until governance\
    \ resolves\n      - Store harmonized rules in Assumptions Register (RIU-008) with\
    \ validation plan\n      \n      Key insight: The goal isn't eliminating conflicts\
    \ — it's making conflict resolution fast, transparent, and auditable. Establish\
    \ the governance *before* you need it."

  question: What testing strategy validates that AI behavior matches human expert
    judgment?
  answer: "Use a multi-layered validation strategy: create expert-labeled datasets,\
    \ measure agreement, automate with LLM-as-a-Judge, and maintain human oversight.\n\
    \      \n      **Step 1: Create Golden Set with experts (RIU-021)**\n      - Generate\
    \ candidate Q&A pairs using LLM, then have experts review/correct\n      - Use\
    \ FMEval triplet format: (question, context, expected_answer)\n      - Include\
    \ edge cases and failure modes discovered during testing\n      - Amazon SageMaker\
    \ Ground Truth Plus provides expert workforce for labeling\n      - Minimum: 50-100\
    \ examples for initial validation; 500+ for robust evaluation\n      \n      **Step\
    \ 2: Measure agreement metrics**\n      - **Recall**: Does AI find what experts\
    \ find?\n      - **Precision**: Does AI avoid false positives experts would reject?\n\
    \      - **F1 Score**: Balanced measure of both\n      - **Win rate**: In head-to-head\
    \ comparison, how often does AI match/beat expert?\n      - **Confidence intervals**:\
    \ Statistical significance of agreement\n      - Target: >80% agreement with expert\
    \ judgment (ρ > 0.8 correlation)\n      \n      **Step 3: Automate with LLM-as-a-Judge**\n\
    \      - Use Amazon Nova LLM-as-a-Judge for unbiased cross-model evaluation\n\
    \      - Use judge from *different model family* to avoid self-preference bias\n\
    \      - Version control evaluation prompts in prompt registry\n      - Validate\
    \ judge outputs against human-labeled subset periodically\n      - Integrate into\
    \ CI/CD with threshold scores (stage-gate testing)\n      \n      **Step 4: Scale\
    \ with RLAIF**\n      - When expert time is limited, use RLAIF (AI-generated feedback)\n\
    \      - Reduces SME workload by ~80% while maintaining quality\n      - Still\
    \ require periodic human audit of AI judge accuracy\n      \n      **Step 5: Production\
    \ validation**\n      - Blue-green deployment: route % of traffic to new model,\
    \ compare outputs\n      - Major releases: require full or partial human evaluation\
    \ before rollout\n      - Escalation-based HITL: route low-confidence outputs\
    \ to human experts\n      - Monitor agreement metrics continuously in production\n\
    \      \n      **PALETTE integration:**\n      - Store Golden Set in RIU-021 (Golden\
    \ Set + Offline Evaluation Harness)\n      - Document evaluation thresholds in\
    \ Success Metrics Charter (RIU-006)\n      - Track expert disagreements as edge\
    \ cases (RIU-014)\n      - Log validation results in decisions.md when they affect\
    \ deployment decisions\n      \n      Key insight: Human experts are ground truth,\
    \ but they don't scale. Use experts to calibrate automated evaluation, then automate\
    \ — but always maintain human audit loop."

  question: How do I build a decision tree from unstructured interview transcripts?
  answer: "Use a 4-stage pipeline: Capture → Extract → Structure → Validate.\n   \
    \   \n      **Stage 1: Capture and transcribe**\n      - Record SME interviews\
    \ (voice capture reduces cognitive load)\n      - Use Amazon Transcribe for speech-to-text\
    \ conversion\n      - Preserve speaker identification for multi-person interviews\n\
    \      - Store raw transcripts in S3 for audit trail\n      \n      **Stage 2:\
    \ Extract decision logic with LLM**\n      Use structured prompts to identify\
    \ decision points:\n      ```\n      Analyze this interview transcript and extract:\n\
    \      1. All decision points where the expert chooses between options\n     \
    \ 2. The conditions/factors they consider for each decision\n      3. The outcomes/actions\
    \ for each branch\n      4. Any exceptions or edge cases mentioned\n      \n \
    \     Format as: IF [conditions] THEN [action] ELSE [alternative]\n      Flag\
    \ any \"it depends\" statements for follow-up.\n      ```\n      \n      - Use\
    \ Amazon Bedrock (Claude, Nova) for extraction\n      - Multi-agent pipeline:\
    \ one agent for classification, one for rule extraction, one for validation\n\
    \      - Extract entities and relationships for knowledge graph (Neo4j + Bedrock)\n\
    \      \n      **Stage 3: Structure into decision tree**\n      - Convert extracted\

    \   source: \"transcript_001, timestamp 12:34\"\n      ```\n      - Link nodes\
    \ to form complete tree\n      - Identify gaps where branches are undefined\n\
    \      - Store in machine-readable format (YAML/JSON) per LIB-020\n      \n  \
    \    **Stage 4: Validate with SME**\n      - Walk through extracted tree with\
    \ original expert\n      - Present edge cases: \"If X and Y, the tree says Z —\
    \ is that correct?\"\n      - Probe gaps: \"What happens when [undefined condition]?\"\
    \n      - Update tree based on corrections\n      - Document validation in Assumptions\
    \ Register (RIU-008)\n      \n      **Quality checks:**\n      - Every leaf node\
    \ has an action (no dead ends)\n      - Every condition has both true/false branches\n\
    \      - Source attribution for each rule (traceability)\n      - Edge cases cataloged\
    \ separately (RIU-014)\n      \n      **PALETTE integration:**\n      - Store\
    \ validated decision trees in RIU-044 (Business Rules Documentation)\n      -\

    \ are ONE-WAY DOORs (compliance, safety decisions)\n      - Use extracted trees\
    \ to build Golden Set for testing (RIU-021)\n      \n      Key insight: LLMs extract\

  question: How do I integrate with an undocumented legacy API that 'just works' in
    production?
  answer: "Treat this as a discovery + documentation + safe integration problem. Never\
    \ assume — observe, document, then integrate.\n      \n      **Phase 1: Discovery\
    \ (reverse engineering)**\n      - **Traffic capture**: Use network monitoring\
    \ tools to observe actual API calls in production\n        - Capture request/response\
    \ pairs for all known operations\n        - Note headers, authentication patterns,\
    \ content types\n        - Record timing characteristics (latency, timeouts)\n\
    \      - **Interview SMEs**: Find the people who built it or maintain it\n   \
    \     - \"What breaks it? What are the edge cases?\"\n        - \"What's the expected\
    \ load? What happens under stress?\"\n      - **Code archaeology**: If source\
    \ available, trace API handlers\n      - **AWS Mainframe Modernization + Micro\
    \ Focus**: For mainframe legacy, generates dependency analysis and interactive\
    \ reports\n      \n      **Phase 2: Document what you learn (RIU-017 Connector\
    \ Spec)**\n      Create a contract even if one doesn't exist:\n      ```yaml\n\
    \      endpoint: \"/api/v1/orders\"\n      method: POST\n      auth: Basic Auth\
    \ (header: Authorization)\n      request_schema: (inferred from observations)\n\
    \      response_codes: [200, 400, 500] # observed\n      timeout: 30s # observed\
    \ p99\n      rate_limit: unknown # test carefully\n      known_edge_cases:\n \
    \       - \"Returns 500 for order_id > 10 digits\"\n        - \"Timezone assumed\
    \ UTC despite no documentation\"\n      confidence: low # until validated\n  \
    \    ```\n      \n      **Phase 3: Safe integration patterns**\n      - **API\
    \ Gateway + Lambda proxy**: Create facade that normalizes legacy behavior\n  \
    \      - Add retry logic, circuit breakers, timeout handling\n        - Transform\
    \ formats (SOAP↔REST, XML↔JSON) if needed\n        - Log all requests/responses\
    \ for debugging\n      - **Leave-and-layer pattern**: Use EventBridge to add capabilities\
    \ without modifying legacy\n      - **Strangler pattern**: Gradually route traffic\
    \ through new facade\n      \n      **Phase 4: Defensive coding**\n      - **Assume\
    \ nothing**: Validate all responses, even \"successful\" ones\n      - **Timeouts**:\
    \ Set explicit timeouts (legacy systems often hang)\n      - **Circuit breakers**:\
    \ Fail fast when legacy system degrades\n      - **Async processing**: For slow\
    \ legacy APIs, use async Lambda + DynamoDB tracking\n      - **Fallbacks**: Define\
    \ behavior when legacy is unavailable\n      \n      **Phase 5: Validation (before\
    \ production)**\n      - **Shadow traffic**: Mirror production requests to new\
    \ integration, compare results\n      - **Smoke tests**: RIU-081 — test critical\
    \ paths in prod-like environment\n      - **Load testing**: Verify legacy can\
    \ handle expected traffic (often the bottleneck)\n      - **Failure injection**:\
    \ Test circuit breakers and fallbacks\n      \n      **PALETTE integration:**\n\
    \      - Document discovered contract in RIU-017 (Connector Spec)\n      - Flag\
    \ integration as ONE-WAY DOOR until validated\n      - Track unknowns in Assumptions\
    \ Register (RIU-008) with validation plan\n      - Add to Risk Register (RIU-009):\
    \ \"Undocumented API behavior may change without notice\"\n      - Create incident\
    \ runbook (RIU-062) for legacy system failures\n      \n      Key insight: \"\
    Just works in production\" means \"works for current use cases under current load.\"\
    \ Your integration may trigger behavior nobody has seen. Observe before you act,\
    \ document everything, and build defensive."

  question: What's the best strategy for handling API rate limits in real-time AI
    systems?
  answer: "Use a layered approach: prevent hitting limits, handle limits gracefully\
    \ when hit, and degrade gracefully when overwhelmed.\n      \n      **Layer 1:\
    \ Prevention (stay under limits)**\n      - **Token budget management**: Implement\
    \ cost sentry with rate limiter workflow to enforce limits before they're hit\n\
    \      - **Prompt caching**: Use Amazon Bedrock's built-in prompt caching + client-side\
    \ caching for repeated queries\n      - **Request batching**: Combine multiple\
    \ small requests where possible\n      - **Model routing**: Route to smaller/faster\
    \ models for simple queries, reserve large models for complex ones\n      - **Application\
    \ inference profiles**: Track usage per tenant/use-case with Bedrock inference\
    \ profiles\n      \n      **Layer 2: Rate control mechanisms**\n      - **Token\
    \ bucket algorithm**: Track tokens/requests per tenant, enforce fair sharing\n\
    \      - **API Gateway throttling**: Set account-level and per-client limits\n\
    \      - **SQS/Kinesis buffering**: Queue requests during spikes, process at controlled\
    \ rate\n      - **Concurrency limits**: Configure Lambda reserved concurrency\
    \ to cap parallel executions\n      \n      **Layer 3: Graceful handling when\
    \ limits hit**\n      - **Exponential backoff with jitter**: Retry with increasing\
    \ delays + randomization to prevent thundering herd\n      ```python\n      delay\
    \ = min(base_delay * (2 ** attempt) + random_jitter, max_delay)\n      ```\n \
    \     - **Streaming responses**: Break long generations into chunks, evaluate\
    \ incrementally\n      - **Circuit breaker**: After N failures, stop retrying\
    \ for cooldown period\n      \n      **Layer 4: Graceful degradation**\n     \
    \ - **Fallback models**: If primary model rate-limited, route to backup (e.g.,\
    \ Nova Micro when Claude unavailable)\n      - **Cached responses**: Serve cached\
    \ results for common queries during rate limit events\n      - **Reduced functionality**:\
    \ Disable non-critical AI features, maintain core functionality\n      - **Queue\
    \ and notify**: Accept request, queue for later processing, notify user of delay\n\
    \      \n      **Monitoring and alerting (RIU-061)**\n      - CloudWatch dashboards\
    \ tracking: tokens used, requests/second, error rates, latency\n      - Alerts\
    \ at 70%, 85%, 95% of rate limits\n      - Cost alerts using AWS Budgets + Cost\
    \ Explorer\n      - Track by inference profile ARN for per-tenant visibility\n\
    \      \n      **Cost optimization:**\n      - Batch mode for non-real-time workloads\
    \ (significant cost savings)\n      - Small, focused agents vs. monolithic prompts\n\
    \      - Provisioned throughput for predictable high-volume workloads\n      \n\
    \      **PALETTE integration:**\n      - Document rate limits in Constraint Profile\
    \ (RIU-007)\n      - Define fallback behavior in Incident Runbook (RIU-062)\n\
    \      - Track token budgets in RIU-522 (Token Budget Management)\n      - Monitor\
    \ with RIU-061 (Observability Baseline)\n      \n      Key insight: Real-time\
    \ AI systems need proactive rate management, not just reactive handling. Budget\
    \ enforcement *before* limits are hit is cheaper than graceful degradation *after*."

  question: How do I design data contracts between AI services and legacy systems?
  answer: "Data contracts define the agreement between systems on data format, semantics,\
    \ and behavior. For AI↔legacy integration, design for compatibility, validation,\
    \ and evolution.\n      \n      **Contract structure (RIU-011 Data Contract Freeze):**\n\
    \      ```yaml\n      contract_id: \"order-ai-enrichment-v2\"\n      version:\
    \ \"2.1.0\"\n      producer: \"legacy-order-system\"\n      consumer: \"ai-enrichment-service\"\
    \n      \n      schema:\n        type: object\n        required: [order_id, customer_id,\
    \ items]\n        properties:\n          order_id: {type: string, pattern: \"\
    ^ORD-[0-9]{10}$\"}\n          customer_id: {type: string}\n          items: {type:\
    \ array, items: {$ref: \"#/definitions/LineItem\"}}\n          # AI-added fields\
    \ (optional for legacy compatibility)\n          ai_risk_score: {type: number,\
    \ minimum: 0, maximum: 1}\n          ai_category: {type: string, enum: [standard,\
    \ priority, review]}\n      \n      compatibility_mode: BACKWARD  # New consumer\
    \ can read old data\n      validation: strict\n      sla:\n        latency_p99:\
    \ 500ms\n        availability: 99.9%\n      ```\n      \n      **Schema management\
    \ with AWS Glue Schema Registry:**\n      - Register schemas for all data exchanges\n\
    \      - Enable compatibility checking (BACKWARD, FORWARD, FULL)\n      - Auto-validate\
    \ on serialization/deserialization\n      - Version tracking with IAM-controlled\
    \ access\n      - Works with MSK, Kinesis, and custom applications\n      \n \
    \     **Compatibility strategies:**\n      | Strategy | When to Use | Rule |\n\
    \      |----------|-------------|------|\n      | BACKWARD | AI adds fields to\
    \ legacy data | New fields must be optional |\n      | FORWARD | Legacy must accept\
    \ AI output | Consumers ignore unknown fields |\n      | FULL | Bidirectional\
    \ compatibility | Both rules apply |\n      | NONE | Breaking changes allowed\
    \ | Coordinate deployment |\n      \n      **Handling AI-specific challenges:**\n\
    \      - **Non-deterministic outputs**: Define acceptable ranges, not exact values\n\
    \      - **Confidence scores**: Include as optional fields with documented semantics\n\
    \      - **Nullable AI fields**: Legacy may not populate fields AI expects — handle\
    \ gracefully\n      - **Format mismatches**: Use transformation layer (Lambda,\
    \ Step Functions) between systems\n      \n      **Validation and testing (RIU-080\
    \ Contract Tests):**\n      - **Schema validation**: Validate all messages against\
    \ registered schema\n      - **Contract tests**: Producer tests verify output\
    \ matches contract; consumer tests verify handling\n      - **Sample payloads**:\
    \ Include representative examples in contract definition\n      - **Edge cases**:\
    \ Document and test boundary conditions\n      \n      **Evolution process:**\n\
    \      1. Propose schema change with compatibility analysis\n      2. Register\
    \ new version in Schema Registry\n      3. Update consumer to handle new + old\
    \ versions\n      4. Update producer to emit new version\n      5. Deprecate old\
    \ version after migration period\n      \n      **PALETTE integration:**\n   \
    \   - Document contracts in RIU-011 (Data Contract Freeze)\n      - Test with\
    \ RIU-080 (Contract Tests)\n      - Track schema changes in Decision Log (RIU-003)\
    \ — often ONE-WAY DOORs\n      - Define SLAs in RIU-070 (SLO/SLI Definition)\n\
    \      \n      Key insight: Legacy systems can't change quickly — design contracts\
    \ with BACKWARD compatibility so AI services can evolve without breaking legacy\
    \ consumers. The contract is the API between teams, not just systems."

  question: What failure handling patterns work for brittle third-party integrations?
  answer: "Brittle integrations fail unpredictably — design for failure with defense\
    \ in depth: prevent, detect, handle, recover.\n      \n      **Layer 1: Prevent\
    \ cascading failures**\n      - **Circuit Breaker**: Stop calling failing service\
    \ temporarily\n        - States: CLOSED (normal) → OPEN (failing, reject calls)\
    \ → HALF-OPEN (test recovery)\n        - Prevents your system from being dragged\
    \ down by third-party failures\n      - **Timeouts**: Set explicit, aggressive\
    \ timeouts (don't wait forever)\n      - **Bulkheads**: Isolate third-party calls\
    \ so one failure doesn't exhaust all resources\n      \n      **Layer 2: Buffer\
    \ and decouple**\n      - **Queue-based load leveling**: SQS between your system\
    \ and third-party\n        - Absorbs spikes, survives temporary outages\n    \
    \    - Lambda processes queue with controlled concurrency\n      - **Async where\
    \ possible**: Don't block user requests on third-party calls\n      \n      **Layer\
    \ 3: Retry safely**\n      - **Exponential backoff with jitter**: `delay = base\
    \ * 2^attempt + random()`\n      - **Idempotency**: Use AWS Lambda Powertools\
    \ idempotency decorator\n        - Stores idempotency keys in DynamoDB\n     \
    \   - Prevents duplicate operations on retry (critical for payments, orders)\n\
    \      - **Retry limits**: Cap retries (e.g., 3-5 attempts), then fail to DLQ\n\
    \      \n      **Layer 4: Fallback strategies**\n      | Pattern | Description\
    \ | Use When |\n      |---------|-------------|----------|\n      | Cross-Region\
    \ Fallback | Same service, different region | Regional outage |\n      | Multi-Model\
    \ Fallback | Different AI model, same provider | Model-specific issues |\n   \
    \   | Multi-Provider Fallback | Different provider entirely | Provider outage\
    \ |\n      | Cached Response | Return stale data | Freshness not critical |\n\
    \      | Degraded Mode | Disable feature, continue core | Non-essential integration\
    \ |\n      | Manual Fallback | Route to human | High-stakes decisions |\n    \
    \  \n      **Layer 5: Capture and recover**\n      - **Dead Letter Queues (DLQ)**:\
    \ Capture failed messages for later processing\n      - **Lambda Destinations**:\
    \ Get detailed failure info (better than DLQ alone)\n      - **Recovery jobs**:\
    \ Scheduled process to retry DLQ messages when service recovers\n      \n    \
    \  **Monitoring and alerting (RIU-061)**\n      - Alert on: error rate spike,\
    \ latency increase, circuit breaker state change\n      - CloudWatch Rules → SNS\
    \ for immediate notification\n      - Dashboard: success rate, p99 latency, DLQ\
    \ depth, circuit breaker status\n      - Test failover in non-production regularly\n\
    \      \n      **PALETTE integration:**\n      - Document failure modes in Risk\
    \ Register (RIU-009)\n      - Define fallback behavior in Incident Runbook (RIU-062)\n\
    \      - Test failure scenarios with RIU-081 (Smoke Tests)\n      - Track third-party\
    \ SLAs in RIU-070 (SLO/SLI Definition)\n      \n      Key insight: Third-party\
    \ integrations are *always* brittle — even \"reliable\" services fail. Design\
    \ assuming the integration will fail, and your system will be resilient when it\
    \ inevitably does."

  question: How do I version APIs when both AI and legacy systems depend on them?
  answer: "API versioning with mixed consumers (AI + legacy) requires balancing innovation\
    \ speed with stability. Use a combination of versioning strategy, compatibility\
    \ layers, and clear deprecation policies.\n      \n      **Versioning strategies:**\n\
    \      | Strategy | Example | Pros | Cons | Best For |\n      |----------|---------|------|------|----------|\n\
    \      | URL Path | `/v1/orders`, `/v2/orders` | Clear, cacheable | URL proliferation\
    \ | Public APIs |\n      | Header | `X-API-Version: 2` | Clean URLs | Hidden versioning\
    \ | Internal APIs |\n      | Query Param | `/orders?version=2` | Easy to test\
    \ | Cache complications | Debug/testing |\n      \n      **Recommended: Header-based\
    \ with CloudFront + Lambda@Edge**\n      - Route requests to different backends\
    \ based on `X-API-Version` header\n      - Store version configuration in DynamoDB,\
    \ cache in Lambda@Edge\n      - Preserve clean URLs while supporting multiple\
    \ versions\n      \n      **Compatibility layer (API Gateway mapping templates):**\n\
    \      - Transform requests/responses to maintain compatibility\n      - Backend\
    \ can evolve while old consumers see consistent interface\n      - Clone API to\
    \ create v2, use mapping templates to bridge differences\n      - Both versions\
    \ coexist, consumers migrate on their schedule\n      \n      **Version lifecycle\
    \ (adapt Kubernetes model):**\n      1. **Alpha**: Experimental, may change without\
    \ notice, AI services only\n      2. **Beta**: Stable interface, may have bugs,\
    \ early adopters\n      3. **Stable**: Production-ready, backward-compatible changes\
    \ only\n      4. **Deprecated**: Still works, sunset date announced, warnings\
    \ emitted\n      5. **Removed**: No longer available\n      \n      **Deprecation\
    \ policy:**\n      - Announce deprecation minimum 6 months before removal (longer\
    \ for legacy)\n      - Emit deprecation warnings in response headers\n      -\
    \ Provide migration guide and tooling to identify deprecated usage\n      - Monitor\
    \ deprecated endpoint usage — don't remove until traffic drops\n      - Document\
    \ in API changelog and notify consumers directly\n      \n      **AI-specific\
    \ considerations:**\n      - AI outputs may be non-deterministic — version the\
    \ *contract*, not the exact output\n      - Include model version in response\
    \ metadata for debugging\n      - AI services can consume newer versions faster\
    \ — use them as early adopters\n      - Legacy systems need longer deprecation\
    \ windows — plan accordingly\n      \n      **Implementation with AWS:**\n   \
    \   - **API Gateway**: Create separate stages or cloned APIs per version\n   \
    \   - **CloudFront + Lambda@Edge**: Route based on headers\n      - **Mapping\
    \ templates**: Transform between versions without backend changes\n      - **Strangler\
    \ pattern**: Facade provides uniform access during migration\n      \n      **PALETTE\
    \ integration:**\n      - Document API versions in RIU-016 (API Contract Review\
    \ + Versioning Plan)\n      - Track breaking changes as ONE-WAY DOORs in Decision\
    \ Log (RIU-003)\n      - Define deprecation timeline in Constraint Profile (RIU-007)\n\
    \      - Test all supported versions with RIU-080 (Contract Tests)\n      \n \
    \     Key insight: Legacy systems can't upgrade quickly — maintain N-1 (or N-2)\
    \ version support. AI systems can move faster — use them to validate new versions\
    \ before legacy consumers migrate."

  question: What's the minimum viable integration test suite for AI-to-legacy connections?
  answer: "A minimum viable integration test suite validates that AI and legacy systems\
    \ communicate correctly without requiring exhaustive coverage. Focus on critical\
    \ paths, failure modes, and contract compliance.\n      \n      **Minimum test\

    \      - Validate AI service outputs match expected schema\n      - Validate legacy\

    \ reach legacy endpoint\n      - Authentication succeeds (tokens, API keys, certificates)\n\
    \      - Basic request/response round-trip works\n      - Run pre/post deployment\n\
    \      ```\n      Test: Legacy order API reachable\n      Assert: GET /health\
    \ returns 200 within 5s\n      Assert: POST /orders with valid payload returns\
    \ 201\n      ```\n      \n      **3. Data Flow Tests**\n      - End-to-end data\
    \ pipeline: ingestion → processing → AI → legacy\n      - For RAG: document ingestion\
    \ → embedding → vector store → retrieval\n      - Verify data transformations\
    \ preserve required fields\n      ```\n      Test: Order flows from legacy to\
    \ AI enrichment to legacy update\n      Assert: Original order_id preserved\n\
    \      Assert: AI-added fields present in final record\n      ```\n      \n  \
    \    **4. Error Handling Tests**\n      - Legacy timeout → AI handles gracefully\n\
    \      - Legacy returns error → AI logs and falls back\n      - Invalid data from\
    \ legacy → AI rejects with clear message\n      - Use service virtualization to\
    \ simulate failure scenarios\n      ```\n      Test: Legacy API returns 500\n\
    \      Assert: AI service returns degraded response (not 500)\n      Assert: Error\
    \ logged with correlation ID\n      Assert: Retry attempted with backoff\n   \
    \   ```\n      \n      **5. Auth/Authz Tests**\n      - Service-to-service authentication\
    \ works\n      - Role-based access controls enforced\n      - Token refresh/rotation\
    \ handled\n      ```\n      Test: AI service authenticates to legacy with service\
    \ account\n      Assert: Valid token accepted\n      Assert: Expired token triggers\
    \ refresh\n      Assert: Invalid token rejected with 401\n      ```\n      \n\
    \      **Optional but recommended:**\n      - **Load/Performance**: OLAF or similar\
    \ for SageMaker endpoints — verify latency under expected load\n      - **UI Journey**:\
    \ Amazon Nova Act headless mode for end-to-end user flows\n      - **Model Accuracy**:\
    \ Smoke test new model versions before production\n      \n      **Test data strategy:**\n\
    \      - Create fixtures representing common cases + known edge cases\n      -\
    \ Use service virtualization (mocks) for legacy system simulation\n      - Sanitize\
    \ production data for realistic test scenarios\n      - Store fixtures alongside\
    \ tests in version control\n      \n      **CI/CD integration:**\n      - Contract\
    \ tests: Every commit (fast, <5 min)\n      - Smoke tests: Every deployment (medium,\
    \ <15 min)\n      - Full integration: Nightly or pre-release (longer, <1 hour)\n\
    \      \n      **\"Minimum viable\" criteria:**\n      - [ ] All 5 test categories\
    \ have at least 1 test each\n      - [ ] Tests run automatically in CI/CD\n  \
    \    - [ ] Critical path (happy path) covered\n      - [ ] At least 1 failure\
    \ scenario per integration point\n      - [ ] Tests pass in staging before production\
    \ deployment\n      \n      **PALETTE integration:**\n      - Define test suite\
    \ in RIU-081 (E2E Smoke Tests)\n      - Contract tests per RIU-080\n      - Document\
    \ test coverage gaps in Assumptions Register (RIU-008)\n      - Include test execution\
    \ in Deployment Readiness (RIU-060)"

  question: How do I handle schema mismatches between AI output and legacy system
    input?
  answer: "Schema mismatches are inevitable when connecting AI (flexible, evolving)\
    \ to legacy (rigid, stable). Use a transformation layer with validation at boundaries.\n\
    \      \n      **Architecture pattern: Transformation Layer**\n      ```\n   \
    \   AI Service → [Transformation Layer] → Legacy System\n                    \
    \     ↓\n                   - Schema mapping\n                   - Field conversion\n\
    \                   - Validation\n                   - Default values\n      \
    \             - Error handling\n      ```\n      \n      **Mismatch types and\
    \ solutions:**\n      \n      | Mismatch Type | Example | Solution |\n      |---------------|---------|----------|\n\
    \      | Field naming | `aiRiskScore` vs `RISK_SCORE` | Field mapping in transformation\
    \ |\n      | Data types | String \"123\" vs Integer 123 | Type coercion with validation\
    \ |\n      | Missing fields | AI omits optional field | Default values or null\
    \ handling |\n      | Extra fields | AI adds fields legacy ignores | Filter to\
    \ expected schema |\n      | Format differences | JSON vs XML | API Gateway +\
    \ Lambda transformation |\n      | Nested vs flat | `{address: {city}}` vs `address_city`\
    \ | Flatten/unflatten logic |\n      | Enum mismatches | \"HIGH\" vs \"3\" | Lookup\
    \ table conversion |\n      \n      **Control AI output schema (prevent mismatches\
    \ at source):**\n      - **Amazon Nova constrained decoding**: Define output schema\
    \ in tool configuration, use Converse API\n      - **Prompt templates as contracts**:\
    \ Enforce output format in system prompt\n      - **JSON mode**: Request structured\
    \ JSON output matching legacy schema\n      ```python\n      # Nova constrained\
    \ output example\n      tool_config = {\n          \"output_schema\": {\n    \
    \          \"type\": \"object\",\n              \"properties\": {\n          \
    \        \"RISK_SCORE\": {\"type\": \"integer\", \"minimum\": 0, \"maximum\":\
    \ 100},\n                  \"CATEGORY_CODE\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"enum\"\
    : [\"A\", \"B\", \"C\"]}\n              },\n              \"required\": [\"RISK_SCORE\"\
    , \"CATEGORY_CODE\"]\n          }\n      }\n      ```\n      \n      **Transformation\
    \ implementation (AWS):**\n      - **Simple transformations**: API Gateway mapping\
    \ templates (no code)\n      - **Complex transformations**: Lambda function between\
    \ AI and legacy\n      - **Streaming data**: Glue Schema Registry for validation\
    \ + SerDe for conversion\n      - **Batch data**: Glue ETL jobs with schema mapping\n\
    \      \n      **Validation at boundaries (AWS Glue Data Quality):**\n      -\
    \ Schema matching: Output conforms to expected structure\n      - Referential\
    \ integrity: Foreign keys exist in legacy system\n      - Data type validation:\
    \ Values within expected ranges\n      - Completeness: Required fields present\n\
    \      ```\n      Rules: [\n        SchemaMatch \"ai_output\" \"legacy_input_schema\"\
    ,\n        ColumnValues \"RISK_SCORE\" between 0 and 100,\n        IsComplete\
    \ \"ORDER_ID\",\n        ReferentialIntegrity \"CUSTOMER_ID\" \"legacy.customers.id\"\
    \n      ]\n      ```\n      \n      **Error handling for mismatches:**\n     \
    \ 1. **Validation failure**: Log error with details, route to DLQ\n      2. **Transformation\
    \ failure**: Return clear error message, don't fail silently\n      3. **Partial\
    \ success**: Decide policy — reject entire record or accept partial?\n      4.\
    \ **Unknown fields**: Log warning, strip and continue (don't break on extras)\n\
    \      \n      **Testing schema compatibility (RIU-080):**\n      - Contract tests\
    \ validate transformation outputs\n      - Test with edge cases: nulls, empty\
    \ strings, boundary values\n      - Test with malformed AI outputs (defensive)\n\
    \      - Regression tests when either schema changes\n      \n      **PALETTE\
    \ integration:**\n      - Document schema mappings in RIU-011 (Data Contract Freeze)\n\
    \      - Validate with RIU-084 (Data Quality Checks)\n      - Test transformations\
    \ with RIU-080 (Contract Tests)\n      - Track schema changes as potential ONE-WAY\
    \ DOORs\n      \n      Key insight: Don't trust AI output blindly — validate at\
    \ the boundary before sending to legacy. Constrained decoding prevents most mismatches;\
    \ transformation layer handles the rest."

  question: What monitoring tells me an integration is degrading before it fails completely?
  answer: "Degradation signals appear before failures — monitor leading indicators,\
    \ not just errors. Focus on trends and percentiles, not just averages.\n     \
    \ \n      **Leading indicators (early warning signals):**\n      \n      | Indicator\
    \ | What It Signals | Alert Threshold |\n      |-----------|-----------------|-----------------|\n\
    \      | Latency p99 increasing | Slowdown before timeout | >2x baseline |\n \
    \     | Error rate trending up | Intermittent failures beginning | >1% or 2x baseline\
    \ |\n      | Queue depth growing | Processing falling behind | >2x normal depth\
    \ |\n      | Retry rate increasing | Transient failures increasing | >5% of requests\
    \ |\n      | Rate limit % consumed | Approaching throttling | >70%, >85%, >95%\
    \ |\n      | Connection pool exhaustion | Resource contention | >80% utilization\
    \ |\n      | Network RTT increasing | Infrastructure degradation | >1.5x baseline\
    \ |\n      | Token/quota consumption | AI cost/rate limits approaching | >70%\
    \ of budget |\n      \n      **SLI/SLO framework (RIU-070):**\n      Define Service\
    \ Level Indicators and Objectives:\n      ```yaml\n      integration_name: \"\
    legacy-order-api\"\n      slis:\n        - name: availability\n          query:\
    \ \"successful_requests / total_requests\"\n          target: 99.9%\n        -\

    \ # Alert if burning error budget 10x faster than sustainable\n      ```\n   \
    \   Use CloudWatch Application Signals for SLI/SLO tracking.\n      \n      **Infrastructure-level\
    \ monitoring:**\n      - **Network Flow Monitor**: Visualize network performance\
    \ across AWS workloads, detect RTT degradation\n      - **EBS latency monitoring**:\
    \ Track storage I/O latency — often hidden cause of integration slowdowns\n  \
    \    - **Lambda debugging**: Monitor for unintended function versions, infinite\
    \ loops, downstream availability\n      - **SQS throttling/backpressure**: Queue\
    \ metrics indicate processing falling behind\n      \n      **Distributed tracing\
    \ (find degradation source):**\n      - **OpenTelemetry**: Auto-instrument with\
    \ Java Agent (no code changes)\n      - **AWS X-Ray + ServiceLens**: Connect metrics,\
    \ logs, and traces\n      - **Trace slow requests**: Identify which integration\
    \ hop is degrading\n      - **Correlation IDs**: Track requests across AI → legacy\
    \ boundaries\n      \n      **CloudWatch monitoring setup:**\n      ```\n    \
    \  # Anomaly detection for latency\n      ANOMALY_DETECTION_BAND(latency_p99,\
    \ 2)\n      \n      # Metrics Insights for dynamic monitoring\n      SELECT AVG(latency),\
    \ COUNT(*) as requests, \n             SUM(CASE WHEN status >= 500 THEN 1 ELSE\
    \ 0 END) as errors\n      FROM integration_metrics\n      GROUP BY integration_name\n\
    \      ```\n      \n      **Alert tiering (escalation):**\n      | Severity |\
    \ Trigger | Action |\n      |----------|---------|--------|\n      | Info | p99\
    \ >1.5x baseline | Log, dashboard highlight |\n      | Warning | p99 >2x OR error\
    \ rate >1% | Page on-call, investigate |\n      | Critical | p99 >3x OR error\
    \ rate >5% OR SLO breach | Immediate response, consider failover |\n      \n \
    \     **AI-specific degradation signals:**\n      - Token consumption rate increasing\
    \ (prompts getting longer/retries)\n      - Model latency increasing (provider\
    \ degradation)\n      - Confidence scores dropping (model quality issues)\n  \
    \    - Guardrail block rate spiking (input quality degrading)\n      - Cost per\
    \ request increasing unexpectedly\n      \n      **Dashboard essentials (RIU-061):**\n\
    \      - Real-time: Request rate, error rate, p50/p95/p99 latency\n      - Trends:\
    \ Hour-over-hour, day-over-day comparisons\n      - Capacity: Queue depth, connection\
    \ pools, rate limit %\n      - Infrastructure: Network RTT, EBS latency, Lambda\
    \ concurrency\n      - Dependencies: Upstream/downstream health status\n     \
    \ - Cost: Token usage, API call costs (for AI integrations)\n      \n      **PALETTE\
    \ integration:**\n      - Define SLIs/SLOs in RIU-070 (SLO/SLI Definition)\n \
    \     - Configure alerts in RIU-061 (Observability Baseline)\n      - Document\
    \ escalation in RIU-062 (Incident Runbook)\n      - Track degradation patterns\
    \ in RIU-063 (Performance Baselines)\n      \n      Key insight: By the time you\
    \ see errors, users already experienced failures. Monitor *latency percentiles*\
    \ and *trends* — they degrade before errors spike. Set alerts at 70% of your failure\
    \ threshold, not 100%."

  question: How do I validate that training data labels mean what stakeholders think
    they mean?
  answer: "Label validation has two dimensions: syntactic (is the label correctly\
    \ applied?) and semantic (does the label mean what we think it means?). Most tools\
    \ focus on syntactic — you must explicitly validate semantic alignment with stakeholders.\n\
    \      \n      **Semantic validation process:**\n      \n      **Step 1: Label\
    \ definition workshop (before labeling starts)**\n      - Gather stakeholders\
    \ (business, SMEs, data scientists, labelers)\n      - For each label/category,\
    \ document:\n        - **Definition**: What does this label mean in business terms?\n\
    \        - **Inclusion criteria**: What must be true for this label?\n       \
    \ - **Exclusion criteria**: What disqualifies this label?\n        - **Boundary\
    \ examples**: Edge cases that are barely in/out\n        - **Common confusions**:\
    \ Labels this might be mistaken for\n      ```yaml\n      label: \"high_risk_order\"\
    \n      definition: \"Order with elevated fraud probability requiring manual review\"\
    \n      inclusion:\n        - \"Order value > $5000 AND new customer\"\n     \
    \   - \"Shipping address differs from billing by > 500 miles\"\n      exclusion:\n\
    \        - \"Existing customer with 3+ successful orders\"\n      boundary_examples:\n\
    \        - \"Repeat customer, high value, different address\" → NOT high_risk\n\
    \        - \"New customer, $4900, same address\" → NOT high_risk (borderline)\n\
    \      confused_with: \"flagged_order\" (different - that's fraud detected, not\
    \ suspected)\n      ```\n      \n      **Step 2: Pilot labeling with SME calibration**\n\
    \      - Label 50-100 samples with both SMEs and labelers\n      - Compare labels:\
    \ Where do they disagree?\n      - Disagreements reveal semantic ambiguity in\
    \ definitions\n      - Refine guidelines based on confusion patterns\n      \n\
    \      **Step 3: Inter-annotator agreement measurement**\n      - Use modified\
    \ Dawid-Skene (MDS) model for consolidation (20% fewer errors than majority voting)\n\
    \      - Metrics to track:\n        - **Cohen's Kappa**: Agreement accounting\
    \ for chance (target: >0.8)\n        - **Krippendorff's Alpha**: Multi-annotator\
    \ agreement (target: >0.8)\n        - **Confusion matrix by labeler**: Which labels\
    \ are confused most?\n      - Low agreement = definition problem, not labeler\
    \ problem\n      \n      **Step 4: Stakeholder validation checkpoint**\n     \
    \ - Present labeled samples to business stakeholders\n      - Ask: \"Is this what\
    \ you meant by [label]?\"\n      - Show edge cases and boundary decisions\n  \
    \    - Get explicit sign-off before full labeling proceeds\n      - Document as\
    \ ONE-WAY DOOR decision (RIU-003)\n      \n      **Step 5: Continuous validation\
    \ during labeling**\n      - Sample 5-10% for quality audit\n      - Use SageMaker\
    \ Ground Truth Review UI for inspection\n      - Track consensus checks: same\
    \ samples to multiple labelers\n      - Implement feedback loops: labelers can\
    \ flag ambiguous cases\n      \n      **AWS tools for label validation:**\n  \
    \    - **SageMaker Ground Truth**: Verification and adjustment workflows\n   \
    \   - **Ground Truth Plus**: Review UI with filtering and feedback\n      - **Label\
    \ chaining**: Verify labels from previous jobs\n      - **Consolidation algorithms**:\
    \ MDS for intelligent aggregation\n      \n      **Red flags that labels don't\
    \ mean what stakeholders think:**\n      - Low inter-annotator agreement (<0.7\
    \ kappa)\n      - High SME override rate on reviewed samples\n      - Model predictions\
    \ stakeholders call \"wrong\" despite correct labels\n      - Different departments\
    \ using same label differently\n      - Labelers frequently asking clarifying\
    \ questions\n      \n      **For GenAI/LLM evaluation:**\n      - Same principles\
    \ apply to preference labels (chosen/rejected)\n      - Document what \"better\
    \ response\" means explicitly\n      - Calibrate evaluators on edge cases before\
    \ full evaluation\n      - Use LLM-as-a-judge to check alignment with human preferences\n\
    \      \n      **PALETTE integration:**\n      - Document label definitions in\
    \ RIU-082 (Label/Category Alignment Check)\n      - Track agreement metrics in\
    \ RIU-084 (Data Quality Checks)\n      - Store boundary examples in RIU-014 (Edge-Case\
    \ Catalog)\n      - Get stakeholder sign-off in decisions.md as ONE-WAY DOOR\n\
    \      \n      Key insight: If two experts disagree on a label, the definition\
    \ is ambiguous — fix the definition before blaming the labelers. Semantic validation\
    \ happens in workshops and reviews, not in code."

  question: What evaluation metrics actually predict production AI performance?
  answer: "Most offline metrics don't predict production success. Focus on metrics\
    \ that correlate with business outcomes and user satisfaction, not just technical\
    \ accuracy.\n      \n      **The metric hierarchy (predictive power):**\n    \
    \  \n      | Metric Type | Predicts Production Success? | Why |\n      |-------------|------------------------------|-----|\n\
    \      | Business outcome metrics | ✅ High | Directly measures what matters |\n\
    \      | User satisfaction proxies | ✅ High | Correlates with adoption |\n   \
    \   | Task completion rate | ✅ Medium-High | Measures real utility |\n      |\
    \ Domain-specific quality | ✅ Medium | Captures use-case fit |\n      | Generic\
    \ accuracy benchmarks | ⚠️ Low | May not reflect your data/use case |\n      |\
    \ Perplexity/loss | ❌ Very Low | Technical, not business-relevant |\n      \n\
    \      **Three-dimensional evaluation framework:**\n      \n      **1. Behavior\
    \ metrics (does it work correctly?)**\n      - **Correctness**: Factual accuracy,\
    \ verifiable claims\n      - **Completeness**: Answers the full question\n   \
    \   - **Faithfulness**: Grounded in provided context (RAG)\n      - **Coherence**:\
    \ Logical, well-structured responses\n      - **Safety**: Toxicity, bias, harmful\
    \ content detection\n      - **Brand voice**: Tone and style alignment\n     \
    \ \n      **2. Cost metrics (is it economically viable?)**\n      - Cost per request\
    \ (tokens + compute)\n      - Cost per successful task completion\n      - Token\
    \ efficiency (output quality per token)\n      - Infrastructure cost at projected\
    \ scale\n      \n      **3. Speed metrics (is it fast enough?)**\n      - Time\
    \ to first token (TTFT)\n      - End-to-end latency (p50, p95, p99)\n      - Throughput\
    \ at peak load\n      \n      **Metrics by application type:**\n      \n     \
    \ | Application | Priority Metrics |\n      |-------------|------------------|\n\
    \      | RAG/Q&A | Context relevance, correctness, faithfulness, citation accuracy\
    \ |\n      | Healthcare | Correctness, completeness, helpfulness, logical coherence\
    \ |\n      | Customer support | Resolution rate, escalation rate, CSAT correlation\
    \ |\n      | Content generation | Brand voice, originality, factual accuracy |\n\
    \      | Classification | Precision, recall, F1 (but validate on production distribution)\
    \ |\n      | Agents | Task completion rate, tool use accuracy, error recovery\
    \ |\n      \n      **Metrics that actually predict production success:**\n   \
    \   \n      1. **Task completion rate on realistic scenarios**\n         - Not\
    \ synthetic benchmarks — real user intents\n         - Include edge cases from\
    \ production logs\n      \n      2. **Human preference alignment**\n         -\
    \ Win rate vs. baseline in blind comparisons\n         - Correlation coefficient\
    \ with human ratings (target: ρ > 0.8)\n      \n      3. **Error rate on high-stakes\
    \ decisions**\n         - Where mistakes have real consequences\n         - False\
    \ positive/negative rates for your use case\n      \n      4. **Latency under\
    \ production-like load**\n         - Not just average — p99 matters for user experience\n\
    \      \n      5. **Cost per successful outcome**\n         - Not cost per request\
    \ — cost per value delivered\n      \n      **Validating offline metrics predict\
    \ production:**\n      ```\n      1. Deploy to shadow/canary environment\n   \
    \   2. Collect production inputs, run through new model\n      3. Compare offline\
    \ evaluation scores to:\n         - User feedback (thumbs up/down, escalations)\n\
    \         - Task completion rates\n         - Business metrics (conversion, resolution)\n\
    \      4. Calculate correlation — if low, your offline metrics are wrong\n   \
    \   ```\n      \n      **AWS implementation:**\n      - **Amazon Bedrock Evaluations**:\
    \ Programmatic + model-as-judge\n      - **Custom metrics**: Define business-specific\
    \ criteria\n      - **Automated pipelines**: Amazon Nova for continuous evaluation\n\
    \      - **CloudWatch**: Cost and latency monitoring\n      \n      **Red flags\
    \ your metrics don't predict production:**\n      - High offline scores but poor\
    \ user feedback\n      - Model \"wins\" on benchmarks but users prefer old system\n\
    \      - Metrics improve but business KPIs don't move\n      - Different ranking\

  question: How do I build continuous evaluation loops for AI systems in production?
  answer: "Continuous evaluation closes the loop: observe production behavior → evaluate\
    \ quality → improve the system → repeat. Without loop closure, you're just monitoring,\
    \ not improving.\n      \n      **The continuous evaluation loop:**\n      ```\n\
    \      ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n      │  \

    \      ```\n      \n      **1. OBSERVE: Collect production data**\n      \n  \
    \    **Explicit feedback:**\n      - Thumbs up/down on responses\n      - User\
    \ corrections/edits to AI output\n      - Escalation to human (implicit negative\
    \ signal)\n      - Report buttons for errors/issues\n      \n      **Implicit\
    \ feedback:**\n      - Task completion rate (did user finish their goal?)\n  \
    \    - Follow-up queries (confused user = bad response)\n      - Session duration\
    \ and engagement\n      - Copy/paste behavior (useful response)\n      - Regeneration\
    \ requests (unsatisfied)\n      \n      **Logging requirements:**\n      ```yaml\n\

    \      \n      **Sampling strategy:**\n      - 100% logging, sampled evaluation\n\
    \      - Random sample: 1-5% for baseline quality\n      - Stratified sample:\
    \ Oversample high-stakes or low-confidence\n      - Triggered sample: 100% of\
    \ flagged/escalated cases\n      \n      **Evaluation methods:**\n      | Method\
    \ | Use Case | Frequency |\n      |--------|----------|-----------|\n      | Automated\
    \ metrics | All traffic | Real-time |\n      | LLM-as-a-judge | Quality assessment\

    \      **AWS implementation:**\n      ```\n      Production Logs → Kinesis → S3\
    \ (raw)\n                                    ↓\n                          Step\

    \      ```\n      \n      **3. IMPROVE: Close the loop**\n      \n      **Automated\
    \ improvement triggers:**\n      - **Drift detected** → Alert + auto-retrain pipeline\n\
    \      - **New failure pattern** → Add to test suite automatically\n      - **Low-scoring\
    \ responses** → Queue for human review\n      - **High-value feedback** → Create\
    \ new golden set examples\n      \n      **Feedback → test case automation:**\n\
    \      ```python\n      # When user reports failure with explanation\n      if\
    \ feedback.type == \"error_report\" and feedback.explanation:\n          new_test_case\
    \ = {\n              \"input\": original_request.input,\n              \"expected\"\
    : feedback.correction or \"should_not_match\",\n              \"source\": f\"\
    user_feedback_{feedback.id}\",\n              \"priority\": \"high\"\n       \
    \   }\n          add_to_evaluation_dataset(new_test_case)\n      ```\n      \n\
    \      **Loop closure mechanisms:**\n      | Signal | Action | Timeline |\n  \
    \    |--------|--------|----------|\n      | Quality score drops | Alert on-call\
    \ | Minutes |\n      | Repeated failure pattern | Add regression tests | Hours\

    \ Drift detected | Trigger retraining | Hours-Days |\n      | New edge cases |\
    \ Update golden set | Weekly |\n      \n      **4. Governance and ownership**\n\
    \      \n      - Assign clear owner for each loop stage\n      - Define SLAs:\
    \ \"Issues detected → action within X hours\"\n      - Regular review: Weekly\
    \ evaluation review meeting\n      - Track loop metrics: Time from detection to\
    \ improvement\n      \n      **PALETTE integration:**\n      - Define evaluation\
    \ pipeline in RIU-540 (Evaluation Harness)\n      - Track metrics in RIU-083 (Evaluation\
    \ Metric Selection)\n      - Store golden set updates in RIU-021\n      - Document\
    \ improvement actions in RIU-532 (Model Registry)\n      - Alert thresholds in\
    \ RIU-061 (Observability Baseline)\n      \n      Key insight: The value isn't\
    \ in collecting feedback — it's in systematically acting on it. An \"observe-evaluate-improve\"\

  question: What's the best way to handle inconsistent data definitions across departments?
  answer: "Inconsistent definitions are a governance problem, not a technical problem.\
    \ You can't automate your way out — you need shared vocabulary with enforcement.\n\
    \      \n      **The problem:**\n      - Sales says \"customer\" = anyone with\
    \ an account\n      - Finance says \"customer\" = anyone who has paid\n      -\
    \ Support says \"customer\" = anyone who has contacted us\n      - AI model trained\
    \ on \"customer\" data — which definition?\n      \n      **Solution: Canonical\
    \ business glossary + enforcement**\n      \n      **Step 1: Establish governance\
    \ structure**\n      - **Data governance champion**: Single accountable owner\n\
    \      - **Cross-functional governance committee**: Representatives from each\
    \ department\n      - **Domain owners**: Department-level authority for their\
    \ data\n      - Use Amazon DataZone domain units to organize by business unit\n\
    \      \n      **Step 2: Create canonical business glossary**\n      ```yaml\n\
    \      glossary_term:\n        term: \"customer\"\n        canonical_definition:\
    \ \"Entity with at least one completed paid transaction\"\n        owner: \"Finance\"\
    \n        approved_date: \"2024-03-15\"\n        \n        department_mappings:\n\
    \          sales: \n            local_term: \"account\"\n            relationship:\
    \ \"superset\"  # All customers are accounts, not all accounts are customers\n\
    \          support:\n            local_term: \"contact\"\n            relationship:\
    \ \"overlapping\"  # Some contacts are customers, some aren't\n            \n\
    \        usage_guidance: \"For AI training on 'customer' data, use this definition\
    \ unless explicitly scoped otherwise\"\n        \n        related_terms: [\"prospect\"\
    , \"lead\", \"account\", \"user\"]\n      ```\n      \n      **Step 3: Map conflicting\
    \ definitions**\n      | Department | Their Term | Canonical Term | Relationship\
    \ | Transformation |\n      |------------|-----------|----------------|--------------|----------------|\n\
    \      | Sales | account | customer | superset | Filter: has_paid = true |\n \
    \     | Support | contact | customer | overlapping | Join with transactions |\n\
    \      | Marketing | lead | prospect | equivalent | Direct mapping |\n      \n\
    \      **Step 4: Enforce through tooling**\n      - **Amazon SageMaker Catalog**:\
    \ Metadata enforcement rules require glossary terms before publishing\n      -\
    \ **Amazon DataZone**: Unified portal with business context and access governance\n\
    \      - **AWS Glue Schema Registry**: Schema validation with canonical field\
    \ names\n      - **Collibra integration**: Bidirectional sync for enterprise-wide\
    \ consistency\n      \n      **Step 5: Technical implementation**\n      ```\n\
    \      Source Data (dept definitions)\n              ↓\n      Transformation Layer\
    \ (mapping rules)\n              ↓\n      Canonical Data Layer (glossary-aligned)\n\
    \              ↓\n      AI/Analytics Consumption\n      ```\n      \n      **Resolution\
    \ process for conflicts:**\n      1. **Identify conflict**: Same term, different\
    \ meanings\n      2. **Document both definitions**: What does each department\
    \ actually mean?\n      3. **Determine canonical**: Which definition serves enterprise-wide\
    \ use?\n      4. **Create mappings**: How to transform from local to canonical\n\
    \      5. **Get sign-off**: Cross-functional committee approval\n      6. **Enforce**:\
    \ Metadata rules require canonical terms for shared assets\n      \n      **Common\
    \ pitfalls:**\n      - Creating glossary but not enforcing it (becomes shelfware)\n\
    \      - Forcing one department's definition on others (creates resistance)\n\
    \      - Not documenting mappings (breaks downstream when source changes)\n  \
    \    - Treating this as IT problem (it's a business alignment problem)\n     \
    \ \n      **For AI specifically:**\n      - Document which definition was used\
    \ for training data\n      - Include glossary version in model metadata\n    \
    \  - Alert if source data definition changes (potential drift)\n      - Validate\
    \ that inference data uses same definition as training\n      \n      **PALETTE\
    \ integration:**\n      - Document canonical definitions in RIU-042 (Taxonomy\
    \ Alignment)\n      - Track definition changes as potential ONE-WAY DOORs (RIU-003)\n\
    \      - Validate alignment with RIU-082 (Label/Category Alignment Check)\n  \
    \    - Include in data dictionary (RIU-011)\n      \n      Key insight: The goal\
    \ isn't to force everyone to use the same definition — it's to know which definition\
    \ applies in each context and transform accordingly. Map, don't mandate."

  question: How do I set data quality thresholds that balance accuracy and velocity?
  answer: "Quality thresholds aren't one-size-fits-all. Set them based on business\
    \ impact: tighter for high-stakes data, looser for speed-critical flows.\n   \
    \   \n      **The tradeoff framework:**\n      ```\n      Accuracy ←――――――――――――――――――→\
    \ Velocity\n      \n      Higher thresholds:           Lower thresholds:\n   \
    \   - More data rejected         - More data passes\n      - Higher quality output\
    \      - More noise in output\n      - Slower throughput          - Faster throughput\n\
    \      - Higher investigation cost  - Higher error cost downstream\n      ```\n\
    \      \n      **Step 1: Classify data by business impact**\n      \n      | Tier\
    \ | Description | Example | Threshold Approach |\n      |------|-------------|---------|-------------------|\n\
    \      | Critical | Errors cause financial/legal harm | Financial transactions,\
    \ PII | Strict, block on failure |\n      | Important | Errors degrade user experience\
    \ | Customer-facing AI outputs | Moderate, alert + continue |\n      | Standard\
    \ | Errors are inconvenient | Internal analytics | Relaxed, log only |\n     \
    \ | Experimental | Errors are expected | Dev/test data | Minimal checks |\n  \
    \    \n      **Step 2: Establish baselines**\n      Before setting thresholds,\
    \ measure current state:\n      ```yaml\n      baseline_metrics:\n        completeness:\
    \ 98.5%  # % non-null for required fields\n        uniqueness: 99.9%    # % unique\
    \ for key fields\n        validity: 97.2%      # % matching format/range rules\n\
    \        freshness: \"< 1 hour\"\n        volume: \"45,000-55,000 records/day\"\
    \n      ```\n      \n      **Step 3: Set thresholds by tier**\n      \n      ```yaml\n\
    \      # AWS Glue DQDL example\n      Rules = [\n        # Critical tier - strict\n\
    \        Completeness \"customer_id\" >= 99.9,\n        IsUnique \"transaction_id\"\
    ,\n        ColumnValues \"amount\" between 0 and 1000000,\n        \n        #\
    \ Important tier - moderate  \n        Completeness \"email\" >= 95.0,\n     \
    \   ColumnValues \"status\" in [\"active\", \"pending\", \"closed\"],\n      \
    \  \n        # Standard tier - relaxed\n        Completeness \"notes\" >= 80.0\n\
    \      ]\n      ```\n      \n      **Step 4: Define threshold types**\n      \n\
    \      | Type | Use Case | Example |\n      |------|----------|---------|\n  \
    \    | Absolute | Known business rules | `amount >= 0` |\n      | Statistical\
    \ | Detect anomalies | `mean(amount) within 2 std of baseline` |\n      | Relative\
    \ | Detect drift | `today's completeness >= 95% of 7-day avg` |\n      | Dynamic\
    \ | Adapt to patterns | `compare to same day last week` |\n      \n      **Step\
    \ 5: Configure actions by severity**\n      \n      ```yaml\n      threshold_actions:\n\
    \        critical_failure:\n          action: \"block\"\n          notify: [\"\
    on-call\", \"data-owner\"]\n          quarantine: true\n          \n        warning:\n\
    \          action: \"continue\"\n          notify: [\"data-team\"]\n         \
    \ log: true\n          \n        info:\n          action: \"continue\"\n     \
    \     log: true\n      ```\n      \n      **Implementation with AWS Glue Data\
    \ Quality:**\n      - Use DQDL labels to tag rules by priority/owner\n      -\
    \ Route failed records to separate S3 bucket (quarantine)\n      - Emit metrics\
    \ to CloudWatch for dashboards/alerts\n      - Set up dynamic rules comparing\
    \ to historical values\n      \n      **Threshold tuning methodology:**\n    \
    \  1. Start with baselines from historical data\n      2. Set initial thresholds\
    \ at baseline - 2 standard deviations\n      3. Run in \"alert only\" mode for\
    \ 2 weeks\n      4. Analyze alerts: false positives? missed issues?\n      5.\
    \ Adjust thresholds based on business feedback\n      6. Gradually tighten for\
    \ critical data\n      \n      **Balancing accuracy vs. velocity:**\n      \n\
    \      | Scenario | Favor Accuracy | Favor Velocity |\n      |----------|----------------|----------------|\n\
    \      | Real-time AI inference | | ✅ |\n      | Financial reporting | ✅ | |\n\
    \      | Customer-facing features | Balance | Balance |\n      | Training data\
    \ pipelines | ✅ | |\n      | Exploratory analytics | | ✅ |\n      | Compliance/audit\
    \ data | ✅ | |\n      \n      **PALETTE integration:**\n      - Define thresholds\
    \ in RIU-084 (Data Quality Checks)\n      - Document baseline in RIU-081 (Smoke\
    \ Tests)\n      - Track quality metrics in RIU-063 (Performance Baselines)\n \
    \     - Alert on breaches via RIU-061 (Observability Baseline)\n      \n     \
    \ Key insight: The right threshold makes the cost of false positives (good data\
    \ rejected) roughly equal to the cost of false negatives (bad data accepted).\
    \ If you're constantly overriding alerts, thresholds are too tight. If errors\
    \ reach users, they're too loose."

  question: What testing strategy catches semantic data bugs before production?
  answer: "Semantic bugs are data that passes schema validation but is meaningfully\
    \ wrong (swapped columns, wrong units, misinterpreted categories). Catch them\
    \ with \"unit tests for data\" that verify business meaning, not just structure.\n\
    \      \n      **Types of semantic data bugs:**\n      | Bug Type | Example |\
    \ Schema Catches? | Semantic Test Catches? |\n      |----------|---------|-----------------|------------------------|\n\
    \      | Swapped columns | customer_id in order_id field | ❌ (both strings) |\
    \ ✅ (format check) |\n      | Wrong units | Pounds stored as kilograms | ❌ (both\
    \ numbers) | ✅ (range check) |\n      | Misinterpreted enum | \"HIGH\"=3 vs \"\
    HIGH\"=1 | ❌ (valid enum) | ✅ (business rule) |\n      | Stale reference | customer_id\
    \ doesn't exist | ❌ (valid format) | ✅ (referential check) |\n      | Aggregation\
    \ error | Sum doesn't equal parts | ❌ (valid number) | ✅ (consistency check) |\n\
    \      | Timezone confusion | UTC stored as local time | ❌ (valid timestamp) |\
    \ ✅ (range/distribution) |\n      \n      **Testing pyramid for data quality:**\n\

    \          # Consistency checks\n          .satisfies(\"line_total == quantity\
    \ * unit_price\", \"line math\")\n      ```\n      \n      **Layer 2: Statistical\
    \ tests (catch distribution shifts)**\n      ```yaml\n      statistical_checks:\n\

    \ validation (catch integration bugs)**\n      - Compare source and target after\
    \ transformation\n      - Verify row counts match (or explain difference)\n  \
    \    - Check that joins don't duplicate/lose records\n      - Use Apache Griffin\
    \ for large-scale dataset comparison\n      ```python\n      # Griffin-style comparison\n\
    \      assert count(source) == count(target), \"Row count mismatch\"\n      assert\
    \ sum(source.amount) == sum(target.amount), \"Amount sum mismatch\"\n      assert\
    \ distinct(source.customer_id) == distinct(target.customer_id)\n      ```\n  \
    \    \n      **Layer 4: Example-based tests (golden set)**\n      - Curate specific\
    \ examples with known correct outputs\n      - Include edge cases and boundary\
    \ conditions\n      - Run as regression tests on every pipeline change\n     \
    \ ```yaml\n      golden_examples:\n        - input: {order_id: \"ORD-0000000001\"\
    , amount: 0}\n          expected: {risk_score: \"low\"}  # Zero-value order =\
    \ low risk\n          \n        - input: {order_id: \"ORD-9999999999\", amount:\
    \ 999999}\n          expected: {risk_score: \"high\"}  # Max-value order = high\
    \ risk\n          \n        - input: {customer_id: null}\n          expected:\
    \ {should_fail_validation: true}\n      ```\n      \n      **CI/CD integration:**\n\
    \      - Run data unit tests on every pipeline change\n      - Block deployment\
    \ if semantic tests fail\n      - Sample production data into test environment\
    \ weekly\n      - Compare test results against known-good baseline\n      \n \
    \     **AWS implementation:**\n      - **Deequ**: Unit tests for Spark-based pipelines\n\
    \      - **AWS Glue Data Quality**: DQDL rules in Glue jobs\n      - **Apache\
    \ Griffin on EMR**: Large-scale dataset comparison\n      - **CloudWatch**: Alert\
    \ on test failures\n      \n      **PALETTE integration:**\n      - Define semantic\
    \ tests in RIU-082 (Label/Category Alignment Check)\n      - Store golden examples\
    \ in RIU-021 (Golden Set)\n      - Run as part of RIU-081 (E2E Smoke Tests)\n\
    \      - Document business rules in RIU-044 (Business Rules Documentation)\n \
    \     \n      Key insight: Schema tests are necessary but not sufficient. The\
    \ most dangerous bugs are semantically wrong data that looks structurally correct.\
    \ Test what the data *means*, not just what it *looks like*."

  question: How do I version control datasets and models together for reproducibility?
  answer: "Reproducibility requires linking exact dataset versions to exact model\
    \ versions. Version them together with shared lineage, not separately.\n     \
    \ \n      **The reproducibility equation:**\n      ```\n      Model v1.2.3 = Code\
    \ v1.2.3 + Data v2024-06-15 + Config v1.2.3\n      \n      If any component changes\
    \ without versioning → reproducibility broken\n      ```\n      \n      **Version\
    \ control strategy:**\n      \n      | Component | Tool | What to Track |\n  \
    \    |-----------|------|---------------|\n      | Code | Git | Training scripts,\
    \ prompts, configs |\n      | Small datasets (<1GB) | Git LFS or DVC | CSVs, JSONs,\
    \ evaluation sets |\n      | Large datasets | LakeFS, S3 versioning, DVC | Training\
    \ data, embeddings |\n      | Models | SageMaker Model Registry | Model artifacts,\
    \ hyperparameters |\n      | Experiments | SageMaker Experiments | Metrics, parameters,\
    \ lineage |\n      \n      **Dataset versioning patterns:**\n      \n      **Pattern\
    \ 1: Immutable snapshots (recommended)**\n      ```\n      s3://data-bucket/datasets/\n\
    \        ├── customers/\n        │   ├── v2024-06-01/\n        │   ├── v2024-06-15/\
    \  ← Training data for model v1.2.3\n        │   └── v2024-07-01/\n        └──\
    \ orders/\n            ├── v2024-06-01/\n            └── v2024-06-15/\n      ```\n\
    \      - Never modify existing versions\n      - Create new version for any change\n\
    \      - Reference by version ID in training config\n      \n      **Pattern 2:\
    \ Git-like branches with LakeFS**\n      ```\n      lakefs://repo/main/datasets/customers/\n\
    \      lakefs://repo/experiment-123/datasets/customers/  ← Branch for experiment\n\
    \      ```\n      - Branch for experiments, merge when validated\n      - Full\
    \ Git semantics (commit, diff, merge)\n      - Works with existing S3-compatible\
    \ tools\n      \n      **Pattern 3: DVC + Git (code + data together)**\n     \
    \ ```bash\n      # Track data with DVC, metadata in Git\n      dvc add data/training.csv\n\
    \      git add data/training.csv.dvc\n      git commit -m \"Training data v2024-06-15\"\
    \n      \n      # Reproduce exact experiment\n      git checkout v1.2.3\n    \
    \  dvc checkout  # Pulls matching data version\n      ```\n      \n      **Linking\
    \ models to data (lineage):**\n      \n      ```yaml\n      model_metadata:\n\
    \        model_id: \"order-risk-v1.2.3\"\n        model_artifact: \"s3://models/order-risk/v1.2.3/\"\
    \n        \n        training_data:\n          dataset: \"customers\"\n       \

    \ epochs: 10}\n          prompt_version: \"v2.1\"\n      ```\n      \n      **AWS\
    \ implementation with SageMaker:**\n      ```python\n      # Register model with\
    \ lineage\n      from sagemaker.model import Model\n      from sagemaker.model_registry\
    \ import ModelPackage\n      \n      model_package = ModelPackage(\n         \
    \ model_package_arn=model_arn,\n          model_data=model_s3_uri,\n         \

    \              \"training_data_version\": \"v2024-06-15\",\n              \"training_data_s3\"\
    : \"s3://bucket/datasets/v2024-06-15/\",\n              \"training_data_hash\"\
    : \"sha256:abc123...\",\n              \"git_commit\": \"abc123def456\"\n    \
    \      }\n      )\n      ```\n      \n      **For GenAI/RAG systems:**\n     \
    \ - Version source documents separately from embeddings\n      - Track embedding\
    \ model version (changing it invalidates all vectors)\n      - Include chunk strategy\
    \ and parameters in version metadata\n      ```yaml\n      rag_version:\n    \
    \    knowledge_base_id: \"kb-v2024-06-15\"\n        source_documents: \"s3://docs/v2024-06-01/\"\
    \n        embedding_model: \"amazon.titan-embed-text-v2\"\n        chunk_size:\
    \ 512\n        chunk_overlap: 50\n        vector_store_snapshot: \"opensearch-index-v2024-06-15\"\
    \n      ```\n      \n      **Minimum viable versioning checklist:**\n      - [\
    \ ] Dataset versions are immutable (never modified in place)\n      - [ ] Model\
    \ metadata includes exact dataset version used\n      - [ ] Code commit hash recorded\
    \ with each training run\n      - [ ] Hyperparameters and configs versioned\n\
    \      - [ ] Can reproduce any past model from stored artifacts\n      \n    \
    \  **PALETTE integration:**\n      - Track dataset versions in RIU-520 (Prompt/Data\
    \ Version Control)\n      - Register models in RIU-532 (Model Registry Integration)\n\
    \      - Document lineage in RIU-083 (Evaluation Metric Selection)\n      - Store\
    \ evaluation sets in RIU-021 (Golden Set)\n      \n      Key insight: \"Versioning\"\
    \ means nothing if you can't answer: \"What exact data trained this exact model?\"\
    \ If you don't record that link, you can't reproduce or debug."

  question: How do I handle data quality issues discovered after model deployment?
  answer: "Post-deployment data quality issues require structured incident response:\
    \ Detect → Assess → Contain → Remediate → Prevent. Speed matters — bad data compounds\
    \ downstream.\n      \n      **Incident response phases:**\n      \n      **PHASE\
    \ 1: DETECT (Minutes)**\n      Already covered by monitoring (LIB-034, LIB-038):\n\
    \      - SageMaker Model Monitor alerts on data drift\n      - Glue Data Quality\
    \ anomaly detection\n      - CloudWatch alarms on quality metrics\n      - User\
    \ reports / escalations\n      \n      **PHASE 2: ASSESS SEVERITY (< 30 minutes)**\n\
    \      \n      Triage questions:\n      1. **Scope**: How much data is affected?\
    \ (% of records)\n      2. **Impact**: What decisions were made with bad data?\n\
    \      3. **Duration**: How long has this been happening?\n      4. **Reversibility**:\
    \ Can affected outputs be corrected?\n      5. **Visibility**: Have users/customers\
    \ been impacted?\n      \n      Severity classification:\n      | Severity | Criteria\
    \ | Response Time |\n      |----------|----------|---------------|\n      | Critical\
    \ | Customer-facing, financial, or safety impact | Immediate |\n      | High |\
    \ Significant business process affected | < 4 hours |\n      | Medium | Internal\
    \ processes affected, workaround exists | < 24 hours |\n      | Low | Minimal\
    \ impact, cosmetic issues | Next sprint |\n      \n      **PHASE 3: CONTAIN (<\
    \ 1 hour for Critical/High)**\n      \n      ```\n      Decision tree:\n     \
    \ \n      Is bad data still flowing?\n      ├── YES → Stop the source\n      │\

    \    ```\n      \n      **PHASE 4: DECIDE - Rollback vs. Fix-Forward**\n     \
    \ \n      | Factor | Favor Rollback | Favor Fix-Forward |\n      |--------|----------------|-------------------|\n\
    \      | User impact | High/visible | Low/internal |\n      | Fix complexity |\
    \ Unknown/complex | Simple/understood |\n      | Time to fix | > 4 hours | < 1\
    \ hour |\n      | Previous version quality | Good | Also degraded |\n      | Business\
    \ criticality | Revenue/safety | Analytics/internal |\n      \n      **Rollback\
    \ procedure:**\n      1. Switch model to previous version (SageMaker endpoint\
    \ update)\n      2. Revert data pipeline to last good state\n      3. Mark affected\
    \ outputs as potentially invalid\n      4. Communicate to stakeholders\n     \
    \ \n      **Fix-forward procedure:**\n      1. Implement data fix (quarantine\
    \ bad, reprocess)\n      2. Test fix in staging\n      3. Deploy to production\n\
    \      4. Validate quality metrics return to baseline\n      5. Reprocess affected\
    \ data if needed\n      \n      **PHASE 5: REMEDIATE (Hours to Days)**\n     \
    \ \n      For affected data:\n      - [ ] Identify all records affected (time\
    \ range, criteria)\n      - [ ] Quarantine or flag affected records\n      - [\
    \ ] Determine if reprocessing is needed\n      - [ ] Reprocess with corrected\
    \ data/model\n      - [ ] Validate outputs against known-good examples\n     \
    \ \n      For affected users/decisions:\n      - [ ] Identify decisions made with\
    \ bad data\n      - [ ] Assess if decisions need to be reversed\n      - [ ] Communicate\
    \ with affected stakeholders\n      - [ ] Document business impact for post-mortem\n\

  question: How do I design runbooks for AI systems that fail in non-obvious ways?
  answer: "AI systems fail differently than traditional software — they degrade silently,\

    \ passes validation |\n      | Drift (data/concept) | Model accuracy declines\
    \ | Works for old patterns, fails on new |\n      | Retrieval failure (RAG) |\
    \ Missing or wrong context | Answer is coherent but grounded in wrong data |\n\
    \      | Prompt injection | Unexpected behavior | Malicious input bypasses guardrails\

  question: What monitoring alerts actually predict AI system failures vs noise?
  answer: "Most AI alerts are noise. Focus on leading indicators that predict failures\
    \ before user impact, not lagging indicators that confirm failures already happened.\n\
    \      \n      **The alert quality problem:**\n      - Security teams face 3,000+\
    \ daily alerts, 60-90% uninvestigated\n      - Alert fatigue leads to ignored\
    \ critical signals\n      - AI systems generate MORE noise (non-deterministic,\
    \ gradual degradation)\n      \n      **Alert classification: Signal vs. Noise**\n\
    \      \n      | Alert Type | Signal (Actionable) | Noise (Ignore/Tune) |\n  \
    \    |------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n      | Error\
    \ rate spike | ✅ >2x baseline in 5 min | ❌ Minor fluctuation |\n      | Latency\
    \ increase | ✅ p99 >3x baseline | ❌ p50 within normal |\n      | Quality score\
    \ drop | ✅ Sustained >10% drop | ❌ Single low-score response |\n      | Token\
    \ usage spike | ✅ >2x sustained | ❌ Brief spike (one request) |\n      | User\
    \ feedback | ✅ Negative trend over hours | ❌ Individual complaint |\n      | Cost\
    \ threshold | ✅ Projected to exceed budget | ❌ Within 10% of baseline |\n    \
    \  \n      **Leading indicators (predict failures):**\n      \n      | Indicator\
    \ | What It Predicts | Alert Threshold |\n      |-----------|------------------|-----------------|\n\
    \      | **p99 latency trending up** | Timeout failures imminent | >1.5x baseline\
    \ sustained 10min |\n      | **Token usage increasing** | Cost explosion / prompt\
    \ issues | >2x baseline sustained |\n      | **Confidence scores dropping** |\
    \ Quality degradation | Avg confidence <0.7 |\n      | **Retry rate increasing**\
    \ | Transient failures becoming persistent | >5% of requests |\n      | **Queue\
    \ depth growing** | Processing falling behind | >2x normal depth |\n      | **Embedding\
    \ distance increasing** | Data drift / semantic shift | Cosine similarity <0.9\
    \ |\n      | **Guardrail trigger rate up** | Input quality degrading | >5% of\
    \ inputs blocked |\n      \n      **Lagging indicators (confirm failures — still\
    \ useful but reactive):**\n      - Error count\n      - User complaints\n    \
    \  - Escalation rate\n      - Failed evaluations\n      \n      **Alert prioritization\

    \ no immediate action\"\n      ```\n      \n      **Noise reduction techniques:**\n\
    \      \n      1. **Use anomaly detection, not static thresholds**\n         ```\n\
    \         # Bad: Static threshold\n         ALARM: latency > 500ms\n         \n\

    \ 2)\n         ```\n      \n      2. **Require sustained violations**\n      \
    \   ```\n         # Bad: Alert on single data point\n         ALARM IF error_rate\
    \ > 5%\n         \n         # Good: Require sustained violation\n         ALARM\
    \ IF error_rate > 5% FOR 3 consecutive minutes\n         ```\n      \n      3.\
    \ **Correlate related metrics**\n         - Don't alert on latency AND errors\
    \ separately\n         - Alert on combined signal: \"latency high AND error rate\
    \ rising\"\n      \n      4. **Suppress during known events**\n         - Deployment\
    \ windows\n         - Scheduled maintenance\n         - Expected traffic spikes\n\
    \      \n      5. **Auto-resolve transient alerts**\n         - If condition clears\
    \ within 5 minutes, log but don't page\n      \n      **Effective CloudWatch alarm\
    \ patterns:**\n      \n      ```yaml\n      # Leading indicator: Latency trending\
    \ up\n      - alarm_name: \"AI-LatencyTrending\"\n        metric: \"InvocationLatency\"\

    \n        description: \"Multiple quality signals degrading together\"\n     \
    \ ```\n      \n      **Metrics that are usually noise:**\n      - Individual request\

    \ Minor fluctuations in token usage\n      - Scheduled job completion variations\n\
    \      \n      **PALETTE integration:**\n      - Define alert tiers in RIU-061\

    \ \n      Key insight: A good alert is one that, when it fires, you always investigate\
    \ and usually find a real problem. If you're ignoring alerts, you have too many\

  question: How do I handle cascading failures in multi-model AI pipelines?
  answer: "Cascading failures occur when one component's failure propagates to dependent\
    \ components. In multi-model pipelines, this is especially dangerous — Model A's\
    \ timeout can exhaust Model B's connection pool, which crashes Model C. Design\
    \ for isolation, not just redundancy.\n      \n      **Cascade failure patterns\
    \ in AI pipelines:**\n      ```\n      Model A fails (timeout)\n           ↓\n\
    \      Model B retries exhaustively (no backoff)\n           ↓\n      Model B\
    \ exhausts connection pool / hits rate limit\n           ↓\n      Model C waiting\
    \ on B times out\n           ↓\n      Entire pipeline fails\n           ↓\n  \

  question: What's the best fallback strategy when AI confidence drops below threshold?
  answer: "Low confidence means the AI doesn't know if it's right. The fallback strategy\
    \ depends on the stakes: low-stakes can fail gracefully, high-stakes need human\
    \ review.\n      \n      **Confidence threshold framework:**\n      \n      ```\n\

    \ for async review, include uncertainty indicator\n      │\n      ├── LOW (0.40-0.65):\
    \ Fallback required\n      │   └── Human review, alternative model, or graceful\
    \ decline\n      │\n      └── VERY LOW (<0.40): Decline to answer\n          └──\
    \ \"I'm not confident enough to answer this\"\n      ```\n      \n      **Fallback\
    \ decision tree:**\n      \n      ```\n      AI confidence < threshold\n     \

  question: How do I test failure scenarios that only happen in production?
  answer: "Production-only failures (scale, timing, real data patterns) require controlled\

    \ under load)\n      - Integration failures (third-party services, network)\n\

    \ security review in deployment gates\n      - Use AIRI (AI Risk Intelligence)\
    \ for automated governance\n      \n      **PALETTE integration:**\n      - Document\
    \ process in RIU-120 (Integration Mode Selection)\n      - Create templates in\
    \ RIU-121 (Deployment Template)\n      - Track deployments in RIU-122 (Deployment\
    \ Registry)\n      - Reference LIB-003 (pilot scoping) for intake process\n  \
    \    \n      Key insight: The pilot team's job isn't done when the pilot succeeds\
    \ — it's done when someone else can deploy the next one without them. Measure\
    \ success by \"time to deploy next use case,\" not just \"pilot worked.\""

  question: How do I eliminate manual steps from AI deployment pipelines?

    \          pre_production_steps=[\n              ShellStep(\"UnitTests\", commands=[\"\
    npm test\"]),\n              ShellStep(\"Evaluation\", commands=[\"python run_eval.py\"\

    \      )\n      ```\n      \n      **Metrics for automation success:**\n     \
    \ - Deployment frequency: Target weekly → daily\n      - Lead time (commit → production):\
    \ Target <1 day\n      - Change failure rate: Target <5%\n      - MTTR: Target\
    \ <1 hour\n      - Manual steps per deployment: Target 0-1\n      \n      **PALETTE\
    \ integration:**\n      - Automate RIU-060 (Deployment Readiness) checks\n   \
    \   - Version prompts in RIU-520 (Prompt Version Control)\n      - Track deployments\
    \ in RIU-121 (Deployment Template)\n      - Auto-populate RIU-122 (Deployment\
    \ Registry)\n      \n      Key insight: Every manual step is a delay, an error\
    \ opportunity, and a scaling bottleneck. Automate everything except decisions\
    \ that require human judgment — and even those should have automated gates that\
    \ only escalate when criteria aren't met."

  question: How do I scale AI operations from 1 customer to 100 without 100x team
    growth?
  answer: "Scaling 100x with <10x team growth requires leverage: multi-tenancy, self-service,\
    \ automation, and shared infrastructure. Every manual, per-customer task becomes\
    \ a scaling bottleneck.\n      \n      **The scaling math:**\n      ```\n    \
    \  1 Customer:   1 FTE dedicated = 1:1 ratio\n      10 Customers: 3 FTE with automation\
    \ = 1:3.3 ratio\n      100 Customers: 8 FTE with platform = 1:12.5 ratio\n   \

  question: How do I design AI systems that work across regions with different regulations?
  answer: "Multi-region AI compliance requires architecture that respects data boundaries\
    \ while enabling global operations. Design for the strictest regulation, then\
    \ relax where permitted.\n      \n      **Key regulatory landscape:**\n      \n\
    \      | Region | Key Regulation | Key Requirements |\n      |--------|----------------|------------------|\n\
    \      | **EU** | EU AI Act (Aug 2024), GDPR | Risk classification, data residency,\
    \ transparency |\n      | **US** | State laws (CA, CO), sector rules | Varies\
    \ by state and sector |\n      | **UK** | UK GDPR, AI framework | Similar to EU\
    \ but diverging |\n      | **APAC** | Country-specific (PDPA, etc.) | Data localization\
    \ requirements vary |\n      | **Global** | ISO IEC 42001 | AI management system\
    \ standard |\n      \n      **Architecture decision framework:**\n      \n   \
    \   ```\n      For each region, determine:\n      \n      1. CAN data leave this\
    \ region?\n         ├── YES → Can use cross-region inference\n         └── NO\
    \ → Need local processing\n         \n      2. WHAT data is restricted?\n    \
    \     ├── All data → Fully local architecture\n         ├── PII only → Anonymize\
    \ before cross-region\n         └── Specific categories → Selective routing\n\
    \         \n      3. WHAT AI risk level applies?\n         ├── High-risk (EU AI\

  question: What's the best pattern for handling customer-specific AI customizations
    at scale?
  answer: "Customer customizations at scale require a layered configuration approach:\
    \ shared platform → customer overrides → environment-specific settings. Don't\
    \ fork code — parameterize everything.\n      \n      **The customization challenge:**\n\
    \      ```\n      1 customer:   Hand-crafted configuration\n      10 customers:\
    \ Copy-paste configurations, drift begins\n      100 customers: Unmaintainable\
    \ mess\n      \n      Solution: Configuration inheritance with overrides\n   \

  question: What explainability is actually required for EU AI Act compliance?
  answer: "EU AI Act explainability requirements depend on risk classification. \"\
    Explainability\" means different things at each level: from simple disclosure\
    \ (\"this is AI\") to comprehensive decision traceability for high-risk systems.\n\
    \      \n      **EU AI Act risk classification:**\n      \n      | Risk Level\
    \ | Examples | Status |\n      |------------|----------|--------|\n      | **Unacceptable**\
    \ | Social scoring, real-time biometric ID in public | PROHIBITED |\n      | **High-Risk**\
    \ | Employment, credit, healthcare, education, critical infrastructure | REGULATED\
    \ |\n      | **Limited Risk** | Chatbots, emotion recognition, deepfakes | TRANSPARENCY\
    \ |\n      | **Minimal Risk** | Spam filters, AI-enhanced games | LARGELY UNREGULATED\
    \ |\n      \n      **Explainability requirements by risk level:**\n      \n  \

  question: How do I handle resistance to AI automation from experienced employees?
  answer: "Resistance from experienced employees is rational — they've built careers\

    \ my expertise won't matter\" | Involve them as domain experts |\n      | \"Customers\

  question: What governance framework prevents shadow AI processes from emerging?
  answer: "Shadow AI emerges when official channels are too slow, restrictive, or\
    \ hard to use. Prevent it with a combination of: easy-to-use sanctioned tools,\
    \ technical guardrails, monitoring for unauthorized use, and governance that enables\
    \ rather than blocks.\n      \n      **Why shadow AI happens:**\n      \n    \
    \  | Root Cause | Example | Prevention |\n      |------------|---------|------------|\n\
    \      | **Sanctioned tools are hard to access** | 3-week approval for ChatGPT\
    \ access | Self-service with guardrails |\n      | **Official process is too slow**\
    \ | IT backlog for AI projects | Fast-track for low-risk use |\n      | **Business\
    \ need isn't met** | \"We need X, IT only offers Y\" | Involve business in tool\
    \ selection |\n      | **Employees don't know tools exist** | \"I didn't know\

  question: How do I design human-in-the-loop systems that people actually use correctly?
  answer: "HITL systems fail when humans rubber-stamp (automation complacency) or\
    \ override everything (automation distrust). Design for appropriate reliance:\
    \ humans trust AI when correct, catch AI when wrong.\n      \n      **Common HITL\
    \ failure modes:**\n      \n      | Failure Mode | What Happens | Why It Happens\
    \ | Prevention |\n      |--------------|--------------|----------------|------------|\n\
    \      | **Rubber-stamping** | Human approves everything | AI usually right, checking\
    \ is tedious | Require specific action, not just \"approve\" |\n      | **Automation\
    \ complacency** | Human stops paying attention | Trust built, vigilance fades\
    \ | Vary task presentation, insert known errors |\n      | **Over-reliance** |\
    \ Human defers to AI even when wrong | AI seems confident, human uncertain | Show\
    \ AI confidence levels, encourage skepticism |\n      | **Under-reliance** | Human\
    \ ignores AI, does manually | Past bad experiences, distrust | Demonstrate accuracy,\
    \ let human verify |\n      | **Skill atrophy** | Human loses ability to do task\
    \ | AI always does it, practice lost | Periodic manual tasks, training refreshers\

  question: What documentation proves AI system decisions are auditable and explainable?
  answer: "Audit-ready documentation answers three questions: \"What did the AI do?\"\
    \ (decision logs), \"Why did it do that?\" (explainability), and \"Who was responsible?\"\
    \ (governance). Maintain these artifacts continuously, not just before audits.\n\

  question: How do I design AI systems that build trust through transparency?

  question: What training enables stakeholders to correctly interpret AI confidence
    scores?
  answer: "Most stakeholders misinterpret confidence scores as \"accuracy\" when they're\
    \ actually \"model certainty\" — a high-confidence wrong answer is common. Training\
    \ must address this gap.\n      \n      **Common misinterpretations to address:**\n\
    \      \n      | Misinterpretation | Reality | Training Fix |\n      |-------------------|---------|--------------|\n\
    \      | \"95% confident = 95% accurate\" | Confidence ≠ accuracy; model can be\
    \ confidently wrong | Teach calibration concept |\n      | \"High confidence =\
    \ trust blindly\" | High confidence + wrong answer = hallucination | Teach verification\
    \ habits |\n      | \"Low confidence = wrong\" | Low confidence may just mean\
    \ uncertain, not incorrect | Teach when to seek more info |\n      | \"Scores\
    \ are comparable across models\" | Different models calibrate differently | Teach\
    \ model-specific baselines |\n      | \"Confidence is binary (trust/don't)\" |\
    \ It's a spectrum requiring judgment | Teach threshold decision-making |\n   \

    \ - When it says 90% confident, it's right ~90% of the time\n      - When it says\
    \ 60% confident, it's right ~60% of the time\n      \n      Overconfident model:\n\
    \      - Says 90% confident, but only right 70% of the time\n      - Common in\
    \ LLMs! They sound certain even when wrong\n      \n      Training message: \"\
    Our model tends to be [well-calibrated / overconfident / \n      underconfident].\
    \ Adjust your trust accordingly.\"\n      ```\n      \n      **2. Threshold framework:**\n\
    \      ```yaml\n      confidence_thresholds:\n        high_confidence:\n     \
    \     range: \">85%\"\n          action: \"Generally trust, spot-check periodically\"\

    \       verification: \"Manual review required\"\n          \n        low_confidence:\n\

    \n          verification: \"Escalate to expert or decline to answer\"\n      ```\n\
    \      \n      **3. Verification habits:**\n      | Confidence Level | Verification\
    \ Action |\n      |------------------|---------------------|\n      | Any level\
    \ | Check if answer makes sense in context |\n      | High confidence | Ask \"\
    Is this the kind of question it's good at?\" |\n      | Medium confidence | Cross-check\
    \ with another source |\n      | Low confidence | Get human expert input |\n \
    \     | Critical decision | Verify regardless of confidence |\n      \n      **Role-specific\

  question: How do I choose between client-server and P2P architecture for small-scale multiplayer games?
  answer: |
    For 4-player co-op games with small teams, the decision depends on your constraints:
    
    **Client-Server (Recommended for Mythfall-style games)**:
    - **Cost**: $0.48-$0.72/user/month using Vultr VPS (per your research)
    - **Pros**: Server authority prevents cheating, easier to patch/update server-side, scales to more players, better for asynchronous gameplay
    - **Cons**: Hosting costs, server becomes single point of failure, requires backend infrastructure
    - **Best for**: Games where anti-cheat matters, competitive gameplay, or you plan to scale beyond 8 players
    - **Implementation**: Godot 4.3+ with Socket.io on Vultr VPS achieves sub-100ms latency for 1,000 concurrent connections
    
    **Peer-to-Peer**:
    - **Cost**: Zero hosting (but TURN servers cost $99-150+/month for 150GB bandwidth if NAT traversal fails)
    - **Pros**: No hosting costs for successful connections, lower latency for direct connections
    - **Cons**: Host advantage, vulnerable to cheating, limited to 4-8 players, 85% NAT traversal success rate means 15% need TURN
    - **Best for**: Co-op games where cheating doesn't matter, very small player counts, zero budget
    - **Implementation**: WebRTC with STUN/TURN fallback
    
    **Hybrid Approach (Best of both)**:
    - Start with P2P for development/testing (zero cost)
    - Add optional dedicated server for players who want it
    - Allows community-hosted servers while maintaining official option
    
    **For your Mythfall context**: Client-server is recommended given your $0.48/user research findings and 4-player co-op focus. The cost is manageable and prevents the 15% TURN server failure case.

    - Approach: 2D isometric, stylized art (not photorealistic)
    - Complexity: MEDIUM (roguelike structure = replayability without massive content)
    - Key insight: Strong design + focused scope > large team + weak design
    
    **Dead Cells (Motion Twin) - Small worker cooperative**:
    - Result: Critical acclaim, strong indie success
    - Approach: 2D roguelite-Metroidvania
    - Complexity: LOW-MEDIUM
    
    **Slay the Spire (MegaCrit) - Very small indie**:
    - Result: Genre-defining hit
    - Approach: Card-based, minimal graphics
    - Complexity: LOW
    
    **Pattern**: Small teams succeed by:
    1. Choosing stylized art over photorealism (reduces art load dramatically)
    2. Using roguelike/roguelite structure (replayability without massive content creation)
    3. Focusing on strong core mechanics over feature breadth
    4. Targeting 3-6 month delivery cycles to build confidence
    
    **For 2-person teams (your context)**:
    - Achievable: 4-player co-op with strong core loop, stylized graphics, procedural elements
    - Not achievable: AAA graphics, massive open world, 100+ hours of unique content
    - Timeline: 12-16 weeks for MVP with systematic implementation (per your infrastructure research)
    
    **Critical**: Engineering complexity ≠ success. Hades beat AAA competitors with 20 people.

  question: How do I optimize multiplayer game hosting costs for indie budgets?
  answer: |
    Based on systematic cost analysis across providers:
    
    **VPS Providers (Most Cost-Effective)**:
    - **Vultr** (Recommended): $0.48-$0.72/user/month at 1,000 user scale
      - 100 users: Vultr High Performance 2GB at $18/month
      - 1,000 users: 12-15 distributed instances at $28/month each
      - Bandwidth: $0.01/GB overage (global pooling across 32 data centers)
    - **Linode**: $36/month for 4GB dedicated CPU, $0.005/GB bandwidth overage
    - **DigitalOcean**: $42/month for 4GB CPU-optimized, 4,000-5,000GB bandwidth included
    
    **Traditional Cloud (5-47x more expensive)**:
    - AWS GameLift: $1.60-$4.75/user/month (reducible to ~$1 with spot instances)
    - Google Cloud: $1,200/month for 1,000 users
    - Azure: $1,400/month for 1,000 users
    - **Avoid unless you need enterprise features**
    
    **Serverless (Moderate cost, operational simplicity)**:
    - Cloudflare Workers: $5/month minimum, $0.30/million requests, NO bandwidth charges
    - Optimization: WebSocket Hibernation API reduces costs to ~$10/month
    - Fly.io: $2.02-$1,013.80/month depending on instance type, $0.02/GB bandwidth
    
    **Technology Stack (Your Research)**:
    - **Engine**: Godot 4.3+ (MIT license, zero cost, 2.4MB builds with Brotli compression)
    - **Networking**: Socket.io (free, open-source, 9,000-10,000 msg/sec per CPU core)
    - **Database**: PostgreSQL 18 (free, asynchronous I/O for high concurrency)
    - **Deployment**: Docker multi-stage builds (90% size reduction)
    - **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana (free, open-source)
    
    **Cost Optimization Strategies**:
    1. Geographic distribution across Vultr regions (global bandwidth pooling)
    2. Connection pooling and read replicas for database
    3. CDN integration for static assets
    4. Auto-scaling based on actual load
    5. Open-source stack (zero licensing costs)
    
    **Target achieved**: $0.48/user/month vs $0.10 target (closest viable solution per research)

  question: What game engine should I choose for web-first indie multiplayer games?
  answer: |
    Based on comprehensive engine evaluation:
    
    **Godot 4.3+ (Recommended for your context)**:
    - **Cost**: MIT license, zero royalties, completely free
    - **Web Export**: Single-threaded exports (no SharedArrayBuffer), works on Apple devices and itch.io
    - **Multiplayer**: High-level API supporting ENet, WebRTC, custom implementations
    - **Bundle Size**: 2.4MB with Brotli compression (down from 40MB uncompressed)
    - **Best for**: Cost-conscious teams, web-first deployment, open-source preference
    - **Limitations**: Smaller asset store than Unity, less enterprise tooling
    
    **Unity (Feature-rich but complex)**:
    - **Cost**: Free under $200K revenue, then subscription required
    - **Multiplayer Options**:
      - Mirror: Free, open-source, WebGL support via WebSockets
      - Netcode for GameObjects: Free but WebGL client-only (no host mode in browser)
      - Photon Fusion: Subscription-based, full WebGL support
    - **Best for**: Teams with Unity experience, need for extensive asset store
    - **Limitations**: Licensing costs at scale, WebGL export requires optimization
    
    **Web-Native Engines (Maximum accessibility)**:
    - **Three.js**: 1.8M weekly downloads, 168.4 kB bundle, seamless Socket.io integration
    - **Babylon.js**: Complete 3D engine, Microsoft-backed, official Colyseus integration
    - **Phaser 3**: Dominates 2D web games, 37,800 GitHub stars, extensive Socket.io tutorials
    - **Best for**: Web developers, immediate browser deployment, zero platform dependencies
    - **Limitations**: Less comprehensive than full game engines, more manual work
    
    **For Mythfall (4-player co-op, mythical theme, small team)**:
    - **Primary recommendation**: Godot 4.3+ with Socket.io
    - **Rationale**: Zero cost, proven web export, your research validates this stack
    - **Alternative**: Three.js if team has strong web dev background
    
    **Decision factors**:
    - Budget: Godot wins (zero cost)
    - Web-first: All options work, Godot 4.3 resolved previous issues
    - Team size: Godot or web-native (less complexity than Unity)
    - Development velocity: Web-native fastest for prototyping, Godot for full game

  question: How do I design effective agent fixtures for validation?
  answer: |
    Based on Palette agent implementation experience (Argentavis ARG-001, Rex REX-001):
    
    **Fixture Structure**:
    ```
    # Fixture: [Descriptive Name]
    Fixture ID: [AGENT-###]
    Agent: [Agent Name] v[Version]
    Scenario: [What situation this tests]
    
    ## Input
    Initial Request: [Exact user input]
    Expected Clarifying Questions: [List of questions agent should ask]
    Sample Answers: [Realistic responses]
    
    ## Expected Output
    [Structured format agent should produce]
    
    ## Success Criteria
    ✅ [Specific, testable criterion]
    ✅ [Specific, testable criterion]
    
    ## Notes
    [What this fixture validates about agent behavior]
    ```
    
    **Key Principles**:
    1. **Test ONE behavior per fixture** - Don't combine multiple scenarios
    2. **Use real examples** - ARG-001 tests "multiplayer networking research" (actual Mythfall need)
    3. **Make success criteria binary** - "Agent asked all 5 questions" not "Agent asked good questions"
    4. **Include failure modes** - What should agent NOT do?
    5. **Provide realistic inputs** - Not edge cases first, test common path
    
    **Fixture Naming**:
    - Format: `[ARK-CODE]-###-[descriptive-name].md`
    - Examples: `ARG-001-multiplayer-networking.md`, `REX-001-multiplayer-architecture.md`
    - Store in: `fde/agents/[agent-name]/fixtures/`
    
    **What to test**:
    - **Clarification phase**: Does agent ask right questions before acting?
    - **Constraint adherence**: Does agent respect its disallowed actions?
    - **Output format**: Does agent produce expected structure?
    - **Decision classification**: Does agent correctly flag ONE-WAY DOOR vs TWO-WAY DOOR?
    
    **Validation workflow**:
    1. Run agent with fixture input
    2. Compare output against success criteria
    3. Log result in decisions.md (success/fail)
    4. Update agent maturity tracking (impressions, fail_gap)
    
    **From Palette experience**:
    - ARG-001 validates Argy's clarification-before-search behavior
    - REX-001 validates Rex's multi-option tradeoff analysis
    - Both test agent stays within role boundaries

  question: How does agent maturity progression work in Palette?
  answer: |
    Palette uses a three-tier maturity model based on empirical reliability:
    
    **Tier 1: UNVALIDATED**
    - **Status**: New agent, unproven
    - **Behavior**: Human-in-the-loop required for EACH execution
    - **Promotion**: 10 consecutive successes
    - **Use when**: Agent just created, major version bump (V1→V2)
    
    **Tier 2: WORKING**
    - **Status**: Proven reliable, but monitored
    - **Behavior**: Autonomous execution with review
    - **Promotion**: 50 impressions with <5% failure rate
    - **Demotion**: Failure occurs while fail_gap ≤ 9 → demote to Tier 1
    - **Use when**: Agent works but needs validation at scale
    
    **Tier 3: PRODUCTION**
    - **Status**: Fully trusted, autonomous
    - **Behavior**: Fully autonomous until failure
    - **Demotion**: Two failures within any 10 impressions (fail_gap ≤ 9) → demote to Tier 2
    - **Use when**: Agent has proven reliability over time
    
    **Tracking Format** (in decisions.md):
    ```
    agent: argentavis
    ark_type: ARK:Argentavis
    version: 1.0
    status: UNVALIDATED
    impressions:
      success: 0
      fail: 0
      fail_gap: 0
    notes: First agent implementation
    ```
    
    **On Success**:
    - Increment `success` count
    - Increment `fail_gap` (runs since last failure)
    - Check promotion criteria
    
    **On Failure**:
    - If `fail_gap ≤ 9`: Demote per tier rules
    - Set `fail_gap = 0`
    - Increment `fail` count
    - Log post-mortem in decisions.md
    
    **Versioning Impact**:
    - **Major bump** (V1.0 → V2.0): Resets impressions + fail_gap, back to UNVALIDATED
    - **Minor bump** (V1.0 → V1.1): Preserves impressions + fail_gap
    
    **Key Insight**: Maturity is about measured trust, not function. A simple agent at PRODUCTION is more valuable than a complex agent at UNVALIDATED.
    
    **Current Palette status** (as of implementation):
    - Argentavis: 1 success, 0 failures, UNVALIDATED (needs 9 more successes)
    - Rex: 0 executions, UNVALIDATED (awaiting first use)

  question: How do I identify ONE-WAY DOOR decisions in AI and game development?
  answer: |
    ONE-WAY DOOR decisions are irreversible or high-cost to undo. Per Palette Tier 1:
    
    **ONE-WAY DOOR Indicators**:
    - "This will affect every system we build"
    - "Changing this later requires rewriting X"
    - "This locks us into vendor Y"
    - "This determines our scaling limits"
    - "This affects our cost structure permanently"
    
    **AI/ML ONE-WAY DOORS**:
    - Ethical AI guidelines and data governance frameworks
    - Model architecture selection (fine-tuning vs RAG vs prompt engineering)
    - Production deployment commitments
    - Database schema for ML features
    - Compliance framework selection (EU AI Act, HIPAA, SOX)
    
    **Game Development ONE-WAY DOORS**:
    - Game engine selection (Godot vs Unity vs Unreal)
    - Network architecture (client-server vs P2P)
    - Database choice (PostgreSQL vs MongoDB vs DynamoDB)
    - Authentication system (OAuth, JWT, custom)
    - Core game mechanics structure (affects all future content)
    - Deployment platform (web vs native vs hybrid)
    
    **TWO-WAY DOOR Examples** (easily reversible):
    - Hyperparameter tuning
    - Prompt iterations
    - UI framework choice
    - Logging library
    - Asset organization
    - Development workflow
    
    **Protocol**:
    1. **Flag explicitly**: "🚨 ONE-WAY DOOR — confirmation required before proceeding"
    2. **Pause execution**: Human confirmation mandatory
    3. **Log in decisions.md**: Must include explicit rationale
    4. **Toolkit-changing decisions**: Also add to manual header list in decisions.md
    
    **When uncertain**: Treat as ONE-WAY DOOR (safer to over-flag than under-flag)
    
    **From Palette implementation**:
    - Agent archetype selection was ONE-WAY DOOR (affects all future agent design)
    - Fixture format was ONE-WAY DOOR (establishes validation pattern)
    - Argy's clarification protocol was TWO-WAY DOOR (can iterate on questions)

  question: What are the required elements of a Semantic Blueprint (Convergence Brief)?
  answer: |
    Per Palette Tier 1, every engagement MUST produce a Semantic Blueprint with these five elements:
    
    **1. Goal** (What success looks like - concrete, measurable):
    - Must be measurable: "Reduce churn 5%" not "Improve experience"
    - Must be concrete: "80% accuracy on 50 test cases" not "Good performance"
    - Must be business outcome: "Launch before Q3" not "Build feature X"
    - Examples: "Reduce ML inference latency to <200ms at p95", "Process 10K transactions/sec with <0.1% error rate", "Deploy compliant HIPAA solution by Q2"
    
    **2. Roles** (Who/what is responsible - human vs agent boundaries):
    - Decision authority: Who makes final calls?
    - Execution responsibility: Who builds what?
    - Review authority: Who validates?
    - Examples: "FDE designs architecture, Kiro implements, customer validates", "Data scientist owns model, MLOps owns deployment, compliance owns audit"
    
    **3. Capabilities** (What tools/agents are needed):
    - Required agents: Argy for research, Rex for architecture, Theri for building
    - Required tools: web_search, fs_write, execute_bash, use_aws
    - Required infrastructure: Cloud services, databases, APIs, frameworks
    - Examples: "Need Argy (research), Rex (architecture), AWS CDK, PostgreSQL", "Need web_search, SageMaker, Lambda, DynamoDB"
    
    **4. Constraints** (What cannot be changed - technical, policy, timeline):
    - Hard boundaries: Budget cap, compliance requirements, timeline
    - Technical limits: Team size, existing infrastructure, data restrictions
    - Policy limits: Security requirements, regulatory compliance
    - Examples: "3-person team, $5K/month budget, 8-week timeline, must use existing VPC", "HIPAA compliance required, no PII in logs, SOC 2 audit in 6 months"
    
    **5. Non-goals** (What is explicitly out of scope):
    - Critical for preventing scope creep
    - Must be explicit to prevent expansion
    - Examples: "NOT building mobile apps, NOT supporting real-time streaming, NOT migrating legacy systems", "NOT implementing custom ML models, NOT building admin UI, NOT handling multi-region"
    
    **Why this matters**:
    - Forces clarity before execution
    - Prevents scope creep
    - Enables restartability (new person can read and continue)
    - Provides decision framework for ONE-WAY DOOR calls
    
    **Implementation**: The Convergence Brief (RIU-001) serves as the semantic blueprint. Must be documented in decisions.md before execution begins.
    
    **Validation test**: If you can't fill all 5 elements, you haven't converged yet.

  question: How do I select RIUs for a given problem in Palette?
  answer: |
    Per Palette Tier 3 workflow, RIU selection follows this process:
    
    **Step 1: Extract Observed Trigger Signals**
    - List explicit signals from engagement input (bullet format)
    - Example: "Stakeholders have conflicting goals", "No clear success metric", "Requirements change weekly"
    
    **Step 2: Retrieve BROAD Candidate RIUs** (aim 8-15):
    - Search taxonomy by trigger_signals (first-class evidence)
    - Use problem_type as soft anchor (not constraint)
    - Bias toward coverage + relevance, not premature narrowing
    - "NO MATCH" is valid - surfaces gaps explicitly
    
    **Step 3: Indicate Match Strength**:
    - **STRONG**: Trigger signals directly match, problem pattern aligns
    - **MODERATE**: Partial match, some signals align
    - **WEAK**: Tangential relevance, consider but don't force
    
    **Step 4: Narrow to Focused Selection** (3-5 RIUs):
    - Prioritize STRONG matches
    - Consider dependencies (some RIUs require others first)
    - Check reversibility (prefer TWO-WAY DOOR RIUs early)
    - Validate against constraints
    
    **Matching Rules**:
    - Coordinates (industry/category/use_case) are soft anchors only
    - Multiple RIUs may apply simultaneously
    - When uncertain, prefer broader coverage over forced fit
    - If no match, surface gap and consider creating new RIU
    
    **Example** (from Palette implementation):
    - **Problem**: "Build first Palette agent"
    - **Trigger Signals**: "New agent needed", "No validation framework", "Need test scenarios"
    - **Candidates**: RIU-511 (Agent Capability Design), RIU-540 (Agent Fixture Design), RIU-003 (Implementation Scoping)
    - **Match Strength**: All STRONG
    - **Selected**: All 3 (logged in decisions.md)
    
    **Anti-patterns**:
    - Don't force RIU match when none fits (surface gap instead)
    - Don't select RIUs based on name alone (check trigger_signals)
    - Don't skip broad candidate phase (premature narrowing loses options)

  question: What must be logged in decisions.md for restartability?
  answer: |
    Per Palette Tier 1 and Tier 3, decisions.md is append-only and must contain:
    
    **A) Toolkit-Changing ONE-WAY DOOR Decisions** (manual header list):
    - Decisions that change Palette itself
    - Example: "Promoted Orchestrator from DESIGN-ONLY to implemented"
    - Keep this section small and current
    
    **B) Engagement Updates** (append new blocks):
    
    **Required in each update**:
    1. **Semantic Blueprint** (or reference to existing):
       - Goal, Roles, Capabilities, Constraints, Non-goals
       - What changed since last update
    
    2. **Selected RIUs**:
       - List of RIUs applied (with match strength if relevant)
       - Rationale for selection
    
    3. **Artifacts Created/Updated**:
       - File paths
       - What each artifact does
    
    4. **Agent Maturity Updates**:
       - Success/failure logged
       - Impressions updated
       - Tier changes noted
    
    5. **Next Checks**:
       - What needs to happen next
       - Open questions or blockers
    
    **Optional (log if material)**:
    - Post-mortems when agents fail
    - Assumptions that drove decisions
    - Knowledge gaps detected (reference KGE-ID)
    
    **Do NOT log**:
    - Exhaustive execution logs
    - Every file touched
    - Every source consulted
    - Routine TWO-WAY DOOR decisions (unless they fail or affect restartability)
    
    **Format**:
    ```
    ---
    ### Engagement Update: YYYY-MM-DD / [DESCRIPTIVE-ID]
    
    #### Semantic Blueprint
    [5 elements or reference]
    
    #### Selected RIUs

    #### Agent Maturity Update
    [Tracking block]
    
    #### Next Checks
    [What's next]
    
    ---
    ```
    
    **Purpose**: Enable restartability from scratch using existing documentation. Someone should be able to read decisions.md and understand what was built, why, and what's next.
    
    **From Palette experience**:
    - Bootstrap entry documents initial toolkit setup
    - Argentavis implementation logged with RIU selection and artifacts
    - Rex implementation logged with maturity tracking

  question: |
    How can I make multi-agent workflows more readable in execution logs?
  
  answer: |
    Use semantic color coding to visualize agent handoffs and coordination.
    
    Palette's 8 agents have semantic colors:
    - Argentavis (Argy): Blue 🔵 - Research/trust/water
    - Therizinosaurus (Theri): Orange 🟠 - Build/action/fire
    - Velociraptor (Raptor): Red 🔴 - Debug/alert/critical
    - Tyrannosaurus (Rex): Purple 🟣 - Design/vision/architecture
    - Yutyrannus (Yuty): Green 🟢 - Narrative/growth/GTM
    - Ankylosaurus (Anky): Gray ⚪ - Validate/stability/foundation
    - Parasaurolophus (Para): Yellow 🟡 - Signal/monitor/light
    - Orchestrator (Orch): White ⚫ - Coordinate/neutral/air
    
    In decisions.md, use colors/emojis to show workflow:
    "Argy (🔵) researched → Rex (🟣) designed → Theri (🟠) built → 
     Anky (⚪) validated → Para (🟡) monitored"
    
    This improves readability by:
    - Making agent roles visually distinct
    - Showing handoff points clearly
    - Enabling quick workflow scanning
    - Reducing cognitive load when reading logs
    
    Use when: Multi-agent engagements (3+ agents)
    Skip when: Single-agent executions (unnecessary overhead)

  question: |
    What should a convergence brief include to accelerate alignment?
  
  answer: |
    Use a structured 5-section template to break the learning curve 
    into manageable segments with clear milestones.
    
    Convergence Brief Template:
    
    1. Problem (What are we solving?)
       - Current state vs desired state
       - Why this matters now
       - Who is affected
    
    2. Context (Constraints, stakeholders, timeline)
       - Binding requirements (hard constraints)
       - Key stakeholders and their roles
       - Timeline and milestones
       - Available resources (agents, tools, budget)
    
    3. Success Criteria (How do we know we're done?)
       - Execution success (artifacts produced, tests passed)
       - Outcome success (business value delivered)
       - Quality success (validation criteria met)
    
    4. Non-goals (What's explicitly out of scope?)
       - Prevents scope creep
       - Makes boundaries clear
       - Enables focused execution
    
    5. Next Steps (What happens after convergence?)
       - Agent routing (who executes what)
       - RIU selection (which patterns apply)
       - ONE-WAY DOOR decisions (approval required)
    
    This structure accelerates convergence by:
    - Reducing back-and-forth clarification
    - Making implicit assumptions explicit
    - Creating shared mental model quickly
    - Enabling fast validation of understanding
    
    Based on onboarding research: Structured pathways reduce 
    ramp time by 30-40% compared to unstructured approaches.

  question: How do I implement least privilege for AI agents?
  answer: |
    Agents should only have access to resources required for their specific role.
    
    Principles:
    - Grant minimum permissions needed to accomplish the task
    - Separate agent identity from user identity and service accounts
    - Use role-based access control (RBAC) for agent permissions
    - Audit and log all agent actions for accountability
    
    Implementation:
    - Define agent roles with explicit permission boundaries
    - Use policy engines to enforce constraints outside model reasoning
    - Implement "before_tool" callbacks to validate parameters
    - Require explicit approval for elevated permissions
    
    Example: Research agent (Argy) gets read-only database access. 
    Build agent (Theri) gets write access only to /src directory.
    Architecture agent (Rex) designs security posture but cannot execute.
    
    Blast radius containment:
    If one agent is compromised, damage is limited to its permission scope.

  question: How do I add guardrails to prevent agent misuse?
  answer: |
    Guardrails are deterministic rules that constrain agent behavior 
    outside the model's reasoning (defense-in-depth).
    
    Two-layer approach:
    
    Layer 1: Deterministic Guardrails (code-based)
    - Hard limits on agent actions (e.g., no purchases >$100)
    - Require human confirmation for irreversible actions (ONE-WAY DOOR)
    - Block access to sensitive APIs without explicit approval
    - Validate tool parameters before execution
    - Enforce rate limits and resource quotas
    
    Layer 2: Reasoning-Based Defenses (AI-powered)
    - Use "LM as Judge" to screen inputs/outputs for policy violations
    - Adversarial training to resist prompt injection
    - Specialized guard models flag risky plans before execution
    - Context-aware policy evaluation
    
    Best practice: Combine both layers. Code provides predictable limits,
    AI provides contextual awareness.
    
    Example guardrail implementation:
    Before agent sends email:
    1. Check: Is recipient on approved list? (deterministic)
    2. Check: Does content violate tone policy? (LM judge)
    3. Check: Does email contain PII without consent? (deterministic + LM)
    4. If any check fails: Block action, log attempt, alert human
    
    Integration with Palette:
    - Rex designs guardrail architecture (what to constrain)
    - Theri implements guardrails (code + configuration)
    - Anky validates guardrails work as intended
    - Para monitors for guardrail violations in production

  question: How do I manage agent identity and authentication?
  answer: |
    Agents are a new class of principal (distinct from users and services).
    Each agent needs verifiable identity for access control and audit.
    
    Three types of principals:
    1. Users: Authenticated with OAuth/SSO (human actors, full autonomy)
    2. Agents: Verified with SPIFFE or similar (delegated authority)
    3. Service accounts: IAM-managed (deterministic applications)
    
    Agent identity requirements:
    - Cryptographically verifiable (e.g., SPIFFE, mTLS)
    - Distinct from user who invoked it
    - Distinct from developer who built it
    - Granular permissions (least privilege per agent role)
    - Auditable (all actions traceable to agent identity)
    
    Why this matters:
    - Enables audit trails (which agent did what, when, why)
    - Limits blast radius if agent is compromised
    - Allows delegation of authority (agent acts on behalf of user)
    - Supports compliance requirements (SOC2, GDPR, HIPAA)
    
    Implementation pattern:
    1. Issue unique identity to each agent instance
    2. Map identity to role-based permissions
    3. Validate identity before every tool invocation
    4. Log all actions with agent identity + timestamp
    5. Rotate credentials regularly
    
    Example: SalesAgent gets CRM read/write access. HRAgent explicitly denied.
    If SalesAgent is compromised, HR data remains protected.
    
    Palette integration:
    - Each agent archetype (Argy, Rex, Theri, etc.) has default permission profile
    - Instances inherit profile but can be further restricted
    - Rex designs identity architecture for multi-agent systems
    - Anky validates identity implementation meets security requirements

  question: How do I classify decisions as reversible vs irreversible?
  answer: |
    All material decisions must be classified before execution.
    
    TWO-WAY DOOR (Reversible):
    - Cheap to undo or change
    - Low organizational impact
    - Can be rolled back without significant cost
    - AI may proceed autonomously
    - Log only if material or if it fails
    - Examples: refactoring code, A/B testing, updating docs, 
      changing variable names, adjusting UI layout
    
    ONE-WAY DOOR (Irreversible):
    - Hard or expensive to reverse
    - High organizational impact
    - Externally binding commitments
    - Requires explicit human approval before proceeding
    - Must be logged with rationale in decisions.md
    - Examples: database selection, architecture commitments, 
      deployments, data deletion, security posture changes,
      API contracts, compliance decisions
    
    The "Trust Trade-Off":
    - Agents need power to be useful (autonomy, tools, access)
    - Every ounce of power introduces risk
    - ONE-WAY DOOR classification manages this trade-off
    - Give agents "a leash long enough to do their job, 
      but short enough to keep them from running into traffic"
    
    Who performs classification:
    - Primary: Rex (Architecture agent) - designs systems, identifies ONE-WAY DOORs
    - Secondary: Any agent that detects a ONE-WAY DOOR must flag and stop
    - Validation: Anky reviews classification during quality checks
    - Override: Human can reclassify if agent gets it wrong
    
    Decision process:
    1. Agent identifies decision point
    2. Classifies as TWO-WAY or ONE-WAY DOOR
    3. If ONE-WAY: Emit "🚨 ONE-WAY DOOR — confirmation required"
    4. Pause execution, present rationale to human
    5. Wait for explicit approval before proceeding
    6. Log decision + rationale in decisions.md
    7. If TWO-WAY: Proceed, log if material
    
    Cost of getting it wrong:
    - Treating ONE-WAY as TWO-WAY: Silent commitments, locked-in risk, 
      irreversible harm, loss of trust
    - Treating TWO-WAY as ONE-WAY: Unnecessary friction, slowed velocity, 
      reduced agent utility
    
    Edge cases:
    - When uncertain: Default to ONE-WAY DOOR (safer)
    - Context matters: Deleting test data = TWO-WAY, deleting prod data = ONE-WAY
    - Cumulative effect: Multiple TWO-WAY decisions can compound into ONE-WAY impact

    - This Library entry provides implementation guidance (reusable)

  question: How do I evaluate agent quality and performance?
  answer: |
    Agent outputs are probabilistic, not deterministic. 
    Traditional unit tests (output == expected) don't work.
    Use multi-layered, artifact-focused evaluation instead.
    
    Layer 1: Deterministic Checks (First Priority)
    - Fixtures: Known inputs → expected outputs
    - Unit tests: Component behavior validation
    - Schema validation: Output structure correctness
    - Constraint checks: Hard limits enforced (e.g., no PII in logs)
    - Pass/fail: Binary, auditable, fast
    
    Layer 2: LM-as-Judge (Second Layer, Produces Artifact)
    - Use powerful model to assess agent output against rubric
    - Rubric dimensions:
      * Correctness: Did it give the right answer?
      * Grounding: Is response factually accurate?
      * Instruction-following: Did it follow constraints?
      * Tone: Is communication appropriate?
    - Output: Scored rubric JSON (artifact, not opinion)
    - Run against golden dataset of prompts + ideal responses
    - Threshold-based pass/fail (e.g., overall_score >= 0.85)
    
    Layer 3: Business Metrics (Top-Down)
    - Goal completion rate
    - User satisfaction scores (thumbs up/down)
    - Task latency
    - Cost per interaction
    - Impact on revenue/conversion/retention
    
    Layer 4: Human Feedback (Ground Truth)
    - Collect bug reports, edge cases, thumbs down
    - Aggregate feedback to identify patterns
    - Convert feedback into new test cases (close the loop)
    - Use RLHF when appropriate (advanced)
    
    Metrics-Driven Development:
    1. Establish baseline scores for production agent
    2. Test new versions against full evaluation dataset
    3. Compare scores: new version vs production
    4. Go/no-go decision based on metrics, not intuition
    5. Use A/B deployments for gradual rollout
    
    Creating Golden Datasets:
    - Sample scenarios from production interactions
    - Cover full breadth of use cases + edge cases
    - Include ideal responses (validated by domain experts)
    - Maintain and expand dataset over time
    - Store as artifacts (JSON, YAML, CSV)
    
    Palette Integration:
    - Ankylosaurus (Anky) performs validation using these methods
    - Deterministic checks first, LM-as-Judge second
    - All evaluations produce artifacts (JSON rubrics, test reports)
    - Agent impressions track success/fail over time
    - Maturity model (UNVALIDATED → WORKING → PRODUCTION) 
      based on measured performance (not opinions)
    
    Example validation workflow:
    1. Theri builds feature
    2. Anky runs deterministic checks (fixtures pass?)
    3. Anky runs LM-as-Judge (rubric scores >= threshold?)
    4. Anky produces evaluation artifact (JSON report)
    5. Human reviews artifact, approves or requests changes
    6. If approved: increment agent success impressions
    7. If failed: increment fail, reset fail_gap, route to Raptor
    
    Anti-pattern: Don't use LM-as-Judge as a black box.
    Always produce scored rubrics as artifacts for human review.
