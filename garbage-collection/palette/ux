# KIRO TASK: Palette UX Improvement Engagement (Testing Cross-Domain Synthesis)

**Mission**: Improve Palette's UX using Palette itself, while testing a new validation principle (cross-domain synthesis) before formalizing it into Tier 1.

**Meta-Context**: This engagement serves two purposes:
1. **Primary**: Create better UX for Palette (GitHub repo, onboarding, visual identity)
2. **Secondary**: Test whether mandatory cross-domain synthesis (Yuty + Anky validation pairing) actually improves outcomes

**Duration**: ~3 hours (one round per agent)

---

## CONVERGENCE BRIEF (RIU-001)

### Goal

Create self-improving UX for Palette that makes the toolkit easier to use and understand out-of-the-box for builders using any AI system (Kiro, Copilot, Claude Code, etc.)

**Success Criteria - Primary**:
1. ✅ Clear GitHub repository structure with download/upload workflow
2. ✅ Visual identity (glyph: programmer/builder with painter's palette of agents)
3. ✅ Onboarding experience that communicates core principles in <5 minutes
4. ✅ Self-improvement mechanism (users can contribute updates)
5. ✅ 1-5 validated FDE use cases per prompt matrix item

**Success Criteria - Meta** (Testing Cross-Domain Synthesis):
1. ✅ Yuty can clearly explain what Palette does and why it's useful
2. ✅ Yuty + Anky validation pairing identifies cross-domain patterns
3. ✅ System improvements discovered (Taxonomy/Library/Prompts updates recommended)
4. ✅ Validation protocol proves useful (or reveals flaws)

---

### Roles

**Human (Mical)**:
- Approves ONE-WAY DOOR decisions
- Reviews each agent's output before next agent proceeds
- Final validation of cross-domain synthesis effectiveness

**Agents (Standard Execution)**:
- **Argentavis (Argy)**: Research UX patterns, GitHub best practices, visual identity (15 min)
- **Tyrannosaurus (Rex)**: Design repo structure, governance model, flag ONE-WAY DOORs (20 min)
- **Therizinosaurus (Theri)**: Build repo structure, templates, contribution guidelines (30 min)
- **Yutyrannus (Yuty)**: **PRIMARY OWNER** - Onboarding narrative + visual identity (45 min)

**Agents (NEW - Cross-Domain Synthesis Validation)**:
- **Parasaurolophus (Para)**: Organize/integrate outputs from Argy/Rex/Theri/Yuty (20 min)
- **Velociraptor (Raptor)**: Debug issues flagged by Para (15 min)
- **Ankylosaurus (Anky)**: **VALIDATION PARTNER** - Work with Yuty to validate quality + identify cross-domain patterns (30 min)

---

### Capabilities

**Standard Palette**:
- All 8 agent archetypes
- Existing artifacts (Taxonomy v1.1, Library v1.0, Tier 1-3)
- GitHub repository creation capabilities
- Visual design tools

**Experimental (Testing)**:
- **Step 6: Cross-Domain Synthesis Validation** (Yuty + Anky pairing)
- Post-execution pattern mining
- System improvement recommendations

---

### Constraints

**Binding Requirements**:
1. **Convergence preserved**: Builder-Palette alignment (NOT autonomous)
2. **Toolkit flexibility**: Must work with Kiro, Copilot, Claude Code, future systems
3. **One round only**: Each agent gets ONE pass (discipline test)
4. **Artifacts provisional**: Everything is improvable
5. **Cross-domain synthesis MANDATORY**: Step 6 cannot be skipped

**Governance**:
- 🚨 ONE-WAY DOOR: Repository structure (hard to change after users clone)
- 🚨 ONE-WAY DOOR: Visual identity/glyph (brand consistency)
- TWO-WAY DOOR: Contribution workflow (can evolve)

---

### Non-Goals

**Out of Scope**:
- ❌ Standalone product (this is a toolkit)
- ❌ Fully autonomous operation
- ❌ Platform-specific implementation
- ❌ Multi-round iteration (one pass only)
- ❌ Complete artifact redesign (improvement only)

---

### Round 4: Yutyrannus (Narrative + Visual) - 45 minutes ⭐ PRIMARY OWNER

**Task**: Create onboarding narrative and visual identity (bread and butter)

**Input**: Argy's research + Rex's architecture + Theri's structure

**Yuty Owns**:

#### Part A: Onboarding Narrative (<5 min to understand)
1. **What is Palette?**
   - Builder's toolkit, not autonomous system
   - Three-tier decision system (Tier 1/2/3)
   - Works with any AI system (Kiro, Copilot, Claude Code)

2. **Why convergence matters**
   - Not autonomous, requires builder-Palette alignment
   - Decisions classified (ONE-WAY vs TWO-WAY DOOR)
   - System learns and improves with use

3. **Core artifacts**
   - Taxonomy (111 RIUs - problem classification)
   - Library (86+ questions - validated solutions)
   - Agents (8 archetypes - bounded roles)

4. **First success path**
   - Clone → Read GETTING_STARTED.md → Run first engagement → Success

#### Part B: Visual Identity
1. **Glyph design**
   - Programmer/builder figure
   - Painter's palette with 8 agent colors:
     * Argy (blue - research/water)
     * Theri (orange - build/fire)
     * Raptor (red - debug/alert)
     * Rex (purple - design/vision)
     * Yuty (green - narrative/growth)
     * Anky (gray - validate/stone)
     * Para (yellow - monitor/light)
     * Orch (white - coordinate/air)

2. **Color scheme** (professional, approachable, developer-friendly)
3. **Typography** (monospace-friendly, readable)
4. **Asset formats** (SVG primary, PNG fallback)

#### Part C: Communication Strategy
1. **README messaging** (hook → explain → get started)
2. **Error messages** (helpful, not cryptic)
3. **Success confirmations** (encouraging, informative)
4. **Contribution acknowledgments** (welcoming, specific)

**Output Format**:
```markdown
# Yuty Deliverables

### Round 7: Ankylosaurus (Validation + Cross-Domain Synthesis) - 30 minutes ⭐ NEW ROLE

**Task**: Validate solution quality AND identify cross-domain patterns (partnership with Yuty)

**Input**: All outputs + fixed artifacts

**NEW PROTOCOL - Step 6: Cross-Domain Synthesis Validation**

This is what we're testing. Anky works with Yuty in "game theory positioning" to validate:

#### Part A: Solution Quality Validation (Standard Anky)

**Questions**:
1. **Did this solution work?**
   - Does the UX actually improve Palette's usability?
   - Are all success criteria met?

2. **Is this the BEST solution we know?**
   - What other approaches could have been used?
   - Are there known UX patterns we didn't apply?

3. **Gaps identified**:
   - What's missing?
   - What could be better?

#### Part B: Cross-Domain Pattern Detection (NEW - Testing)

**Questions** (Work with Yuty):
1. **Does this reveal patterns applicable to other problems?**
   - UX principle → Could it apply to agent coordination?
   - Onboarding pattern → Could it apply to convergence briefs?
   - Visual identity → Could it apply to RIU presentation?

2. **What did we learn that should update our artifacts?**
   - New Library entries? (UX patterns validated)
   - RIU routing changes? (Better trigger signals discovered)
   - Prompt updates? (Agent coordination improved)

3. **Cross-domain synthesis examples**:
   - Find 1-3 concrete examples where UX learnings could apply elsewhere
   - Example format: "[UX Pattern] could improve [Other Domain] because [Reasoning]"

#### Part C: Yuty Partnership (Game Theory Positioning)

**Yuty asks** (Semantic):
- Can I explain this solution clearly?
- Does the narrative make sense?
- Is this iteration defensible?

**Anky asks** (Quality):
- Did it work?
- Is it the best we know?
- What alternatives exist?

**Both ask** (Cross-Domain):
- Where else could this apply?
- What should we update in the system?
- Did we do the best iteration possible?

#### Part D: FDE Use Case Validation (Standard Anky)

**Create 1-5 use cases per Palette prompt matrix item**:

1. **Intake and Convergence**
   - Use case: Builder discovers Palette, unclear problem
   - Entry point: README.md
   - Expected outcome: Convergence achieved in <10 min

2. **Architecture and Design**
   - Use case: Builder needs system design help
   - Entry point: Rex agent + RIU taxonomy
   - Expected outcome: ONE-WAY DOOR flagged correctly

3. **Implementation**
   - Use case: Builder has spec, needs execution
   - Entry point: Theri agent + fixture examples
   - Expected outcome: Working artifact produced

4. **Quality and Safety**
   - Use case: Builder wants validation
   - Entry point: Anky agent + validation protocol
   - Expected outcome: Quality issues identified

5. **Operations and Delivery**
   - Use case: Builder monitoring production
   - Entry point: Para agent + alerting setup
   - Expected outcome: Anomalies detected

6. **Adoption and Change**
   - Use case: Team onboarding to Palette
   - Entry point: GETTING_STARTED.md + examples
   - Expected outcome: First success in <5 min

**Output Format**:
```markdown

## CRITICAL REMINDERS

**For Kiro**:
1. ⚠️ This is a TEST of cross-domain synthesis - pay attention to whether it works
2. ⚠️ Yuty + Anky pairing is experimental - document effectiveness
3. ⚠️ ONE-WAY DOORs must be approved before proceeding
4. ⚠️ Human review required after each agent (don't batch execute)
5. ⚠️ Meta-goal is as important as primary goal (test the principle)

**For Mical**:
1. Review
